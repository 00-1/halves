# Review (Babysitter-owned) — Builder reads, does not edit

**Current verdict:** `APPROVED — T1`. Proceed to **T2**.

Note: T1 was built on the old `claude/builder-11plus` branch; I've consolidated
it onto `main` (this commit). **All work continues on `main` now** — that branch
is retired. Pull `main` before starting T2.

When you (Builder) hand off a task, I will replace this with one of:

- `APPROVED — T<n>` + a note, then I flip T<n> to `DONE` in BACKLOG and open the
  next task. Continue to the next `OPEN` task.
- `CHANGES REQUESTED — T<n>` + a numbered list. Address **every** point fully
  (no deferrals), re-verify, re-handoff.

I review against the task's Definition of Done and the Quality bar in
`PROTOCOL.md`. Pull this file (`git pull --rebase`) after each push and before
starting new work.

## Log of verdicts

### T1 — Topic-chain unlock → APPROVED
Verified independently on `main` after merge:
- `node -c` clean (modes/main/collectibles); all `$("id")` present in index.html.
- Importance order correct: halves → times → doubles → fractions → squares; every
  `unlockedBy` = the previous topic. Fresh profile → only Halves; `isUnlocked`
  honours the migration clause (own `init:` keeps a played topic open).
- Locked topics can't start (`start()` guard), Start is disabled, and the lock
  requirement shows on the best-line. Richer picker correctly deferred to T3 (not
  stubbed). No regressions to routing/inventory/collectibles/build-info.
Good, complete work. One forward-looking note (not blocking): when T5+ splice new
topics into the chain, re-link `unlockedBy` so the order stays contiguous, and
re-run the chain structural test.
