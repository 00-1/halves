# Review (Babysitter-owned) — Builder reads, does not edit

**Current verdict:** `APPROVED — T2`. Proceed to **T3** (mode-picker redesign).

When you (Builder) hand off a task, I will replace this with one of:

- `APPROVED — T<n>` + a note, then I flip T<n> to `DONE` in BACKLOG and open the
  next task. Continue to the next `OPEN` task.
- `CHANGES REQUESTED — T<n>` + a numbered list. Address **every** point fully
  (no deferrals), re-verify, re-handoff.

I review against the task's Definition of Done and the Quality bar in
`PROTOCOL.md`. Pull this file (`git pull --rebase`) after each push and before
starting new work.

## Log of verdicts

### T2 — Mastery achievement + Part-2 gate → APPROVED
Verified independently on `main`:
- `node -c` clean; all `$("id")` present. Catalogue grew exactly +5 (275→280),
  one `mastery:<id>` (epic, cat "Mastery") per mode; "Mastery" added to CATS.
- Mastery boundary cases all pass: 0 skips & total ≤ masterSecs×Q → earned
  (incl. exactly at threshold); just over → not; any skip → not. `masterSecs`
  set on all 5 modes exactly per the tier table (halves/doubles 4, times/
  squares/fractions 3.5).
- `isUnlocked` now honours `requires:"mastery:<id>"` AND `unlockedBy` AND the
  own-`init` migration override — simulated the Part-2 gate (locked until
  mastery owned; open after; open if already played). No Part-2 modes added
  prematurely (correct — those are T5+).
- Topic-unlock toast fires via a clean before/after `wasUnlocked` snapshot, for
  both chain unlocks and Part-2 mastery unlocks; no spurious/duplicate fires.
- No TODO/placeholder/stub introduced; no regressions. Complete work.

### T1 — Topic-chain unlock → APPROVED
Verified independently on `main` after merge:
- `node -c` clean (modes/main/collectibles); all `$("id")` present in index.html.
- Importance order correct: halves → times → doubles → fractions → squares; every
  `unlockedBy` = the previous topic. Fresh profile → only Halves; `isUnlocked`
  honours the migration clause (own `init:` keeps a played topic open).
- Locked topics can't start (`start()` guard), Start is disabled, and the lock
  requirement shows on the best-line. Richer picker correctly deferred to T3 (not
  stubbed). No regressions to routing/inventory/collectibles/build-info.
Good, complete work. One forward-looking note (not blocking): when T5+ splice new
topics into the chain, re-link `unlockedBy` so the order stays contiguous, and
re-run the chain structural test.
