# Review (Babysitter-owned) — Builder reads, does not edit

**Current verdict:** `APPROVED — T3`. Proceed to **T4** (per-topic completion + new milestones).

When you (Builder) hand off a task, I will replace this with one of:

- `APPROVED — T<n>` + a note, then I flip T<n> to `DONE` in BACKLOG and open the
  next task. Continue to the next `OPEN` task.
- `CHANGES REQUESTED — T<n>` + a numbered list. Address **every** point fully
  (no deferrals), re-verify, re-handoff.

I review against the task's Definition of Done and the Quality bar in
`PROTOCOL.md`. Pull this file (`git pull --rebase`) after each push and before
starting new work.

## Log of verdicts

### T3 — Mode-picker redesign → APPROVED
Verified independently on `main`:
- `node -c` clean; ids present; no stale `.mode-tab/.modes/.lk` refs.
- Scrollable grouped picker (`.picker`, 42vh scroll, max-width 360). `MODE_GROUPS`
  exported (`Core, Number, Fractions & %, Measures, Reasoning`); confirmed **every
  mode's group is in the list — 5/5 render, none orphaned** (the main risk).
  Empty groups skipped.
- Rows show name, subline (rank·score / "No best yet" / unlock requirement),
  `have/total` progress, and a state glyph (▶ / 🔒 / ✓). Locked rows are not
  selectable (click guard). 100% (`done`) only when have===total of the full
  per-mode set (halves 59 incl. all Beat/Spark + Lightning + Mastery) → matches
  "100% = mastery". `renderTabs()` re-runs on nav-back and init, so routing works.
- No TODO/placeholder/stub; no regressions. Complete work.
- Non-blocking nit (future cleanup, do NOT fix now): `renderBest`'s locked branch
  is now effectively unreachable since `mode` is always unlocked; harmless.

### T2 — Mastery achievement + Part-2 gate → APPROVED
Verified independently on `main`:
- `node -c` clean; all `$("id")` present. Catalogue grew exactly +5 (275→280),
  one `mastery:<id>` (epic, cat "Mastery") per mode; "Mastery" added to CATS.
- Mastery boundary cases all pass: 0 skips & total ≤ masterSecs×Q → earned
  (incl. exactly at threshold); just over → not; any skip → not. `masterSecs`
  set on all 5 modes exactly per the tier table (halves/doubles 4, times/
  squares/fractions 3.5).
- `isUnlocked` now honours `requires:"mastery:<id>"` AND `unlockedBy` AND the
  own-`init` migration override — simulated the Part-2 gate (locked until
  mastery owned; open after; open if already played). No Part-2 modes added
  prematurely (correct — those are T5+).
- Topic-unlock toast fires via a clean before/after `wasUnlocked` snapshot, for
  both chain unlocks and Part-2 mastery unlocks; no spurious/duplicate fires.
- No TODO/placeholder/stub introduced; no regressions. Complete work.

### T1 — Topic-chain unlock → APPROVED
Verified independently on `main` after merge:
- `node -c` clean (modes/main/collectibles); all `$("id")` present in index.html.
- Importance order correct: halves → times → doubles → fractions → squares; every
  `unlockedBy` = the previous topic. Fresh profile → only Halves; `isUnlocked`
  honours the migration clause (own `init:` keeps a played topic open).
- Locked topics can't start (`start()` guard), Start is disabled, and the lock
  requirement shows on the best-line. Richer picker correctly deferred to T3 (not
  stubbed). No regressions to routing/inventory/collectibles/build-info.
Good, complete work. One forward-looking note (not blocking): when T5+ splice new
topics into the chain, re-link `unlockedBy` so the order stays contiguous, and
re-run the chain structural test.
