## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 3: the FULL EARNING, proven vs earning-vectors ([B], GO)

T233 landed `earning.json` + `earning-vectors.json` on halves `main` (`fde819a`), unblocking the
whole award rule (retiring the Speed/Rank "data gap" I'd flagged). Re-synced into goblin-gold and
**ported the full earning, proven against every vector** — same contract as transforms-vs-parity.
`00-1/brickmap` `4347b0b`.
- **`earning.rs`** re-implements the live logic (`gg1/dev/collectibles.js`) with tunables from
  `earning.json`:
  - `rank_index(score,total,time)` — accuracy brackets while imperfect, avg-seconds once perfect;
    reproduces all **732** rankIndex vectors.
  - `award(ctx)` — the per-round evaluator (ranks · init · flawless · speed · mastery · per-question
    solve/spark · games/modes/flawless meta), honouring the ctx invariant
    **`mistakes==skipped==total−answered`** (a *wrong* answer lowers score + marks the question but
    is NOT a skip). Reproduces all **46 modes × 13 scenarios**, reconstructing each scenario's ctx
    exactly as `tools/earning-export.js` does — including a **collation-aware natural sort** for the
    first-prompt (symbols precede digits, matching JS `localeCompare` numeric; this was the one
    initial miss — `cubes` `√36` vs `2³`).
  - `collector/topics/meta/gold/momentum_awards` — the count/threshold evaluators; full families
    reproduced.
- goblin-gold **49** lib tests green (4 new earning proofs); clippy -D warnings clean native +
  aarch64-linux-android. Pushed to `main` + the feature branch.
- **Next (this directive's "Also"):** wire `earning::award` into the app's `finish_round` (awards →
  the save), then surface them. Combat resolution + the gold-formula bodies still await **T233b**.
  → phase 4 audio · 5 polish.

## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 3 (part 2): daily EVENTS (14-event rotation) ([B], GO)

The last pure-data metagame layer: GG1's daily events, re-impl'd over the `Events` collectibles.
`00-1/brickmap` `d3e727a`. With this the metagame **data layer is complete** (collector · save ·
catalogue · arena · events).
- **`events.rs`**: derives the **14** events (id + prose title from the participation blurb) from the
  `Events` category; `Event::reward_key(tier)` builds the `event:<id>[:well|:ace]` keys for the three
  tiers (participation/well/ace) — verified to be **exactly the 42** Events collectibles (none
  missing, none extra). `scheduled(utc_day)` = the **14-day rotation** (`day mod 14`);
  `touched(collected)` maps earned keys back to events. Reward keys are `collected`-map keys (the
  keystone), so earning = inserting them.
- **Honest scope (data-seam rule):** per-event **content** (topics/transforms, the well/ace
  thresholds) and the cycle's **canonical anchor/order** are JS-only (not exported) → the schedule
  rotates the 14 in a stable catalogue order (structurally faithful, not the canonical phase); reward
  keys + earned-state are fully data-backed. Documented in the module — a known gap, alongside the
  Speed/Rank thresholds and the Arena combat formula.
- goblin-gold **46** lib tests green (4 new); clippy -D warnings clean native + aarch64-linux-android.
  Pushed to `main` + the feature branch.
- **Next (integration):** wire the metagame into the live app — `run_award_keys` → the save in
  `finish_round`, and surface collected/heroes/events on screen. Then phase 4 audio · 5 polish.
  APK/feel + audio-by-ear → `OWNER-EYEBALL.md`. *(Data gaps to unblock when convenient: a thresholds/
  schedule/combat-rules export for Speed/Rank/Events-content/Arena-fight.)*

## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 3 (part 2): the ARENA (bestiary + roster + boost bridge) ([B], GO)

Re-impl of the Arena's combatants over `balance.json`, and the payoff for all that collecting.
`00-1/brickmap` `acf1386`. **The collecting→fight bridge:** every catalogue item carries a
`boost:{hero,stat,amount}`, so a hero's **effective** stats = base + the boosts of everything the
player has collected.
- **`arena.rs`**: the **bestiary** (120 enemy tiers, ascending `def`, three types — Brawn/Arcane/
  Cunning — a **boss** ending each region of `regionSize`=12 → 10 bosses) and the **roster** (12
  heroes, 4 base stats power/guard/speed/focus, typed 4-per-type), loaded + integrity-checked.
  `hero_stats(id, collected)` folds the earned items' boosts into the targeted hero (using
  `catalogue::earned` + the new `boost` field); `bosses()`/`is_boss(n)` mark region capstones.
- Added a `boost` field to `catalogue::Collectible` (all 2352 carry one; heroes balanced ~196 boosts
  each, stats ~590 each — verified all reference real roster ids).
- **Honest scope (data-seam rule — NOT fabricated):** the actual **combat resolution** (how the four
  stats + the type triangle decide a win, and the gold-formula bodies) lives only in the JS, not the
  export → modelled-not-resolved; the fight math awaits a rules export. Documented in the module.
- goblin-gold **42** lib tests green (5 new); clippy -D warnings clean native + aarch64-linux-android.
  Pushed to `main` + the feature branch.
- **Next:** **events** (14 daily, UTC-day cycle) · wire `run_award_keys` into the app's
  `finish_round` (drop awards into the save). → phase 4 audio · 5 polish. APK/feel + audio-by-ear →
  `OWNER-EYEBALL.md`.

## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 3 (part 2): the full collectible CATALOGUE (2352) ([B], GO)

Re-impl of GG1's whole reward set over the T230/T232 export (`collectibles.json`). `00-1/brickmap`
`b4d35f8`. **Keystone:** a collectible's **`id` IS its key in the save's `collected` map** — so
"earned" = "id is collected" and awarding = inserting the id (the design that lets progression /
collector / catalogue all derive from one map).
- **`catalogue.rs`** models all 2352 entries across 10 categories and proves the shape vs the
  export's own `categories`/`total` + unique ids (mirrors GG1's `collectibles.test.js`).
- **Earning re-implemented for what the export pins down**, verified vs the catalogue:
  - **Initiation / Flawless / Mastery** as per-run awards (`run_award_keys`): init on ≥half answered,
    flawless on a no-skip finish, mastery via progression's `masterSecs` gate — proven one-per-mode
    across all **46** topics, every produced key a real catalogue id.
  - **gold / momentum milestones** by their numeric thresholds (the entries' `gold`/`momentum`).
  - **Collector** cross-checked against the collect-N ladder (`collector.rs`) + its 3 named specials
    (`beast`/`goblinking`/`voidbeast`).
- **Honest scope (data-seam rule — NOT fabricated):** **Speed** tiers and **Rank** thresholds live
  only in the `desc` prose, and **Solved/Spark/Events** + `meta`/`topics` milestones are awarded by
  gameplay events the export doesn't quantify → **count/structure-verified only**; their earning
  awaits a thresholds export (or the JS). Documented in the module so it's a known gap, not a silent
  one.
- goblin-gold **37** lib tests green (6 new); clippy -D warnings clean native + aarch64-linux-android.
  Pushed to `main` + the feature branch.
- **Next:** wire `run_award_keys` into the app's `finish_round` (drop awards into the save) · **Arena**
  (enemies/heroes vs `balance.json`) · **events** (14 daily, UTC-day cycle). → phase 4 audio · 5
  polish. APK/feel + audio-by-ear → `OWNER-EYEBALL.md`.

## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 3: 2 OWNER-FOUND on-device PARITY BUGS fixed ([B], 🔴→GREEN)

The two FIX-FIRST bugs the owner found on a real phone (core drill faithfulness). `00-1/brickmap`
`39ecb7c`.

**1. Solver auto-accept (no Enter-to-submit).** GG-web's `press()`→`checkAuto()` auto-accepts the
instant `parseFloat(input)==answer` (checked after *every* keypress); the bottom bar is **SKIP**
(reveals the answer + advances, counts as a skip); input is capped at **5 digits** (decimal
excluded) and a **leading dot becomes `0.`**. Re-authored `drill.rs` to match the live runtime:
- No submit, **no wrong state** — `Mark::{Right,Skipped}`; `press` auto-checks after each digit/dot
  and the action bar skips (revealing the answer). 5-digit guard + `''→'0.'` implemented.
- `app.rs`: the FX fires on the keypress that *solves*; the round ends on `solved+skipped` (not
  `solved` alone); skips fold into progression (`answered = solved`, so initiation needs ≥half
  *answered* and mastery still needs zero skips). Action-bar label → "Skip"; the banner reflects
  auto-check/skip (the "Try again" wrong-state is gone). **`drill-initial` golden re-blessed.**
- The engine keypad widget's `Enter` is now documented as a game-defined **action bar** (the widget
  stays data-free; the game decides submit/skip).

**2. Immersive-sticky fullscreen.** The status + nav bars overlaid the drill. `scraped-again` has no
immersive setup to copy, and cargo-apk packages a bare `NativeActivity` (no Java of ours for a
theme), so a new **`immersive.rs`** reaches the framework over **JNI** from the native side:
`FLAG_FULLSCREEN` + legacy `setSystemUiVisibility(IMMERSIVE_STICKY|…)` + the API-30+
`WindowInsetsController.hide(systemBars())`, re-applied on every `resumed` (the flags clear on focus
loss). Every JNI call is **guarded so a wrong-thread / missing-method / thrown exception can only
no-op (logged), never crash** — built blind (no NDK locally; owner device-judges), so it degrades
gracefully rather than risking another launch crash. Pinned `jni 0.21` (classic `JNIEnv` API)
alongside android-activity's rewritten 0.22.x — they only share the raw VM pointer (via
`ndk-context`), so no entanglement.

Gates: goblin-gold **31** lib tests + pure goldens green; **3** GPU goldens pass under lavapipe;
clippy -D warnings clean on native + aarch64-linux-android. Pushed to `main` + the feature branch.
- **Next:** owner re-checks the two fixes on-device (auto-accept feel + bars hidden) → then resume
  the **metagame** — the rest of the catalogue (init/flawless/speed/mastery + rank/milestone counts
  vs `collectibles.json`), **Arena** (enemies/heroes vs `balance.json`), **events**. → phase 4 audio
  · 5 polish. APK/feel + audio-by-ear → `OWNER-EYEBALL.md`.

---

## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 3 (part 2): the SAVE model over the engine Store seam ([B], GO)

The metagame's **keystone**, per `GG1-INVENTORY.md` §5: GG1 keeps *one* central `collected` map
(`{<key>:{ts}}`) and derives everything from it — progression, the collector ladder, event/arena
state. A new feature is a new key prefix, not a schema bump. `00-1/brickmap` `f910988`.
- **`save.rs`** (`Save{collected, gold, last_mode}`) (de)serialising through any
  `bm-platform::save::Store` — `FileStore` on native/Android, `WebStore` on web — so the game never
  sees the platform. `gold` round-trips through the **string-float** shape the live runtime writes
  on disk; a torn blob loads as `default` rather than bricking launch.
- **`Save::progress()`** rebuilds `progression::Progress` from the `init:`/`mastery:` keys via a new
  `Progress::from_collected` bridge — the save is the single source of truth for what's unlocked,
  not a side table. `mark` keeps the *earliest* timestamp (a key is "first collected" once) and
  reports newness.
- goblin-gold **26** tests green (5 new: round-trip, derived progress, mark semantics, gold string
  shape, corrupt-blob tolerance); clippy -D warnings clean native + aarch64-linux-android. Pushed to
  `main` + the feature branch.
- **Next (per NEXT.md, FIX-FIRST):** the 2 owner-found on-device parity bugs — **(1) solver
  auto-accept** (no Enter-to-submit; auto-accept the instant `parseFloat(input)==answer`, bottom key
  = SKIP, 5-digit guard + decimal point) and **(2) immersive-sticky fullscreen** on the goblin-gold
  activity — *then* resume the metagame catalogue (init/flawless/speed/mastery + rank/milestone) ·
  Arena · events.

## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 3 (part 2): metagame UNBLOCKED — collector ladder ([B], GO)

My earlier "missing data" blocker was a **false alarm** — I'd checked the stale feature-branch
working tree, not `origin/main`. `content/gg1/{guides,collectibles,balance}.json` were on halves
`main` all along (T230 `6b7387b` + T232 `e24ae3c`), `GG1-INVENTORY.md` on `claude/agent`. **Lesson
logged: re-fetch + check `origin/main` before declaring data missing.** `00-1/brickmap` `41ccf81`.
- **Re-synced `content/gg1/`** into goblin-gold `data/gg1/` (added `guides.json`, `collectibles.json`
  — 2352-item catalogue + the collector ladder, `balance.json` — gold + Arena tuning). modes/parity
  unchanged (parity test stays green).
- **Banked the collector ladder** (`collector.rs`), data-driven from `collectibles.json`'s
  `collectorLadder`: `ladder()` / `earned(count)` + GG1's `collector.test.js` invariant as a Rust
  test — **the capstone (2300) must stay strictly below the catalogue total (2352) to be reachable**
  (export's `catalogTotal`/`capstoneReachable` cross-checked). Ascending tiers, valid rarities/ids,
  threshold-gated earning.
- goblin-gold **21** tests green; clippy -D warnings clean on native + aarch64-linux-android. Pushed
  to `main` + the feature branch.
- **Continuing (phase 3 part 2):** the rest of the catalogue (init/flawless/speed/mastery + solved/
  spark + rank/milestone counts vs `collectibles.json`), **Arena** (enemies/heroes vs `balance.json`),
  **events**, **save** via `bm-platform::save` (schema in `GG1-INVENTORY.md`). → phase 4 audio · 5
  polish. APK/feel + audio-by-ear → `OWNER-EYEBALL.md`.

---

## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 3 (part 1): all 46 topics + topic-select ([B], GO) · ⚠️ metagame BLOCKED (false alarm — see above)

Phase 2 APPROVED → phase 3. Did the **un-blocked** half; the **metagame** half is **blocked on
missing data** (see below). `00-1/brickmap` commit `14fe684`.
- **Drive all 46 topics:** `Drill::from_topic(id)` generates a topic's questions from its pool via
  the phase-2 transforms (the data-driven path); a test drives **all 46** — every topic yields
  questions and every generated answer is accepted.
- **Generic question UI:** `drill_frame` now shows the transform prompt verbatim (`100`, `3 × 7`,
  `area 10×7`) under the topic-name heading — the halves-only "Half of …" framing is gone.
  `drill-initial` golden re-blessed.
- **Topic-select screen (new):** heading + unlocked-count + a row per **unlocked** topic (mastered
  green, else gold), tap-routed; `app.rs` is now a two-screen runtime (Select ⇄ Drill) — tapping a
  topic starts a round, completing it folds into `progression` (initiation + mastery by round time)
  and newly-unlocked topics appear back on Select. New `topic-select.png` golden + pure & lavapipe
  GPU tests.
- Gates: goblin-gold **18** tests + **3** GPU goldens (lavapipe) green; clippy -D warnings clean on
  native + aarch64-linux-android; workspace fmt clean. Pushed to `main` + the feature branch.

### ⚠️ BLOCKER for the metagame (Babysitter, please route to Builder A / T230)
The phase-3 metagame — **collector ladder, arena (enemies+heroes), daily events** — must consume
the **T230/T232 exports** + a spec that **do not exist yet**: `content/gg1/` currently holds only
`modes.json` + `parity-vectors.json` (+ `transforms.md`). **Missing:** `collectibles.json`,
`balance.json`, `guides.json`, and **`docs/agent/GG1-INVENTORY.md`**. I will NOT fabricate that
data (it would diverge from the canonical export and break the one-way data seam). **Unblock by
running T230 (content export part 2) + writing `GG1-INVENTORY.md`**, then I'll sync + build the
metagame data-driven (same as transforms/progression) and gate it on tests/goldens.
- **Next when unblocked:** collector ladder (`collectibles.json` → the per-mode init/flawless/speed/
  mastery + collector/topic ladders, re-impl from `collectibles.js` behaviour vs the export) ·
  arena/heroes (`balance.json`) · events · save schema via `bm-platform::save`. → phase 4 audio · 5
  polish. APK installs/feel + audio-by-ear → `OWNER-EYEBALL.md`.

---

## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 2: GG1 logic in Rust vs the parity vectors ([B], GO)

Phase 1 APPROVED → phase 2: re-implement the GG1 game **logic** in Rust, proven against the T229
data (share DATA not code — the JS is never run). `00-1/brickmap` commit `f7e6ea3`.
- **`transforms.rs` — all 46 topic transforms** (`datum→{p,a}`), re-authored from the behaviour.
  **THE GATE** (`every_mode_reproduces_its_parity_vectors`): for every mode, the `{p,a}` set our
  Rust transform produces from the `pool` equals `parity-vectors.json` **exactly** — same count,
  every vector matched (prompt byte-identical, answer within 1e-9), no extras. **All 46 pass.**
  `generate(id)` yields a topic's questions; number→string mirrors JS `String(n)` so prompts match.
- **`progression.rs` — unlock-chain + mastery.** Initiation ("played") = answered ≥ ⌈total·0.5⌉
  (the spine `unlock:{by:X}` trigger); Mastery = **no skips AND totalTime ≤ masterSecs·total** (the
  off-spine `unlock:{mastery:X}` trigger); `is_unlocked` = played | gate | always-open root. Tests:
  graph loads all 46 with valid targets, **spine-gates-on-play vs offspine-gates-on-mastery**, the
  init/mastery thresholds, and **the whole graph is satisfiable** (no deadlock — every topic
  reachable + masterable from halves).
- Pure logic (serde_json only, no engine dep). goblin-gold **17** tests green; clippy -D warnings
  clean on native + aarch64-linux-android. Pushed to `main` + the feature branch.
- **Next:** phase 3 content (T230 guides/collectibles + `GG1-INVENTORY.md`) · 4 audio re-author ·
  5 polish; the metagame (collector ladder / arena / events) + wiring the drill to all 46 topics
  via `generate()`/progression are the phase-3+ sub-phases. APK installs + audio-by-ear →
  OWNER-EYEBALL.

## BRICKMAP-GG1 FULL PORT — phase 1: bank the engine services ([B], GO — autonomy grant)

Gate #4 declared PASS (code+golden, no device — the crash fix landed `ba383ae` AND the initial-frame
golden verifies the crashing path headlessly) → brickmap GO. Per the autonomy grant I proceeded
(ungated) to the **full port, phase 1: bank the spike's proven UI/text/save into the engine crates**
so they're reusable engine services (the research's "these sink into bm-render later").
- **`bm-render::text2d`** (`8d8f1da`): the legible **2-D prose** service — bake a TTF face to an AA
  coverage atlas + word-wrap (the #1 dependency). bm-render gains `ab_glyph`; the font FACE stays
  game content (goblin-gold::text is now a re-export keeping the bake/layout tests by its asset).
- **`bm-render::ui2d`** (`a3c6876`): the on-screen **2-D UI surface** contract — `RectRun`/`TextRun`
  primitives, the shared quad `UI_SHADER`, and the data-free **keypad** widget (moved with its
  tests). The headless golden painter + the app's surface renderer both build from these →
  pixel-identical UI. **BOTH GPU goldens (fx-correct, drill-initial) still match under lavapipe** —
  the bank is behavior-preserving.
- **`bm-platform::save`** (`010e631`): a durable key→bytes `Store` trait — `FileStore`
  (native/Android, atomic write+rename, path-traversal-safe keys) + `WebStore` (`localStorage`, hex).
- goblin-gold is now a thin consumer of the engine services. Gates: bm-render **28** tests /
  goblin-gold **11** / bm-platform **5** green; workspace `clippy -D warnings` + `fmt` clean on
  native, `save` clean on wasm32 too, goblin-gold clean on aarch64-linux-android; `scraped-again`
  (the other bm-render consumer) unaffected. Pushed to `main` + the feature branch.
- **Next:** phase 2 (re-impl GG1 topic logic in Rust vs the T229 parity vectors), phase 3 (content
  via T229/T230), phase 4 (audio re-author), phase 5 (polish) — each gated on tests/goldens; APK
  installs + audio-by-ear → the owner-eyeball-on-return list, don't block.

## BRICKMAP-GG1 spike — mini-gate #4: on-device LAUNCH CRASH fixed (empty vertex buffer) ([B], 🔴→GREEN)

The APK force-closed on launch (Adreno 735, Android 16). Two cycles:
1. **Made the cause visible** (`0b3174a`): Android's default Rust panic handler writes to **stderr**,
   which `adb logcat` doesn't capture — so the `panic→abort` had no cause. Added a
   `std::panic::set_hook` that `log::error!`s the payload+location via the wired `android_logger`,
   plus surface-cap fallbacks. Owner's `adb logcat` then named it.
2. **Root cause + fix** (`ba383ae`): the live render built a **vertex buffer per text run** via
   `create_buffer_init`, which panics **"buffer slices can not be empty"** when a run has **zero
   quads**. On the drill's **first frame the answer box is empty** → empty buffer → abort. Never
   caught because the headless bins only rendered non-empty states; **the live `app.rs` path was
   unexercised until the device** — exactly what gate #4 exists to catch.
   - **Guard the whole class:** skip empty text runs before `create_buffer_init` in BOTH the live
     `Gfx::render` AND `headless::build_drawables` (rects were already guarded; the FX sparks are
     rects, so there's no separate particle buffer — audited per the directive).
   - **Share the render:** `app.rs` now builds the frame from the **same** `headless`
     `RectRun`/`TextRun` via a new `drill_frame(...)` builder used by **both** the device renderer
     and a headless golden — so the exact on-device first frame is the one self-verified offscreen.
   - **Regression lock:** new golden `drill-initial.png` (empty answer box, no FX) + a `#[ignore]`
     GPU test that **re-renders the crash state under lavapipe** (proves no panic + matches golden),
     plus a pure CI test. Native + `aarch64-linux-android` clippy -D warnings clean; fmt + 16 pure
     tests green; both GPU goldens pass under lavapipe.
- Rebuild triggered on the `main` push → new `goblin-gold-<sha>-android-arm64.apk` on the `dev`
  prerelease / Android-APK run. **Owner re-installs `dev.brickmap.goblingold` + device-judges.** ✅
  #1/#2/#3 stand. **HOLD for the owner re-test → go/no-go.**

---

## BRICKMAP-GG1 spike — mini-gate #4: native APK (drill + keypad + FX, fullscreen) ([B], GO — FINAL gate)

Babysitter gated #3→#4 (GO). Built the **final** mini-gate in `00-1/brickmap:crates/goblin-gold`
(commit `14a9aa8`, pushed to `main` + the feature branch): a **windowed runtime** that boots the
**drill + keypad + correct-answer FX FULLSCREEN** through a real wgpu **surface**, packaged by
`cargo-apk` into a **native Android APK** (no voxel world) — proving the re-platform runs
**on-device**, not just headless.
- **`app.rs`:** a winit `ApplicationHandler` + wgpu **surface** runtime. Each frame renders the
  live drill screen (heading/progress, the framed question from the **T229 seam**, the answer box
  with the typed value + verdict colour, the keypad, the banner); **touch** (Android) / left-click
  (desktop) hit-tests the **data-free `Keypad`** and drives the `Drill`. A correct answer fires the
  **engine-native FX**: an **animated gold spark burst** (`bm-render::particles`) under the engine
  **palette-dither bloom** (`bm-render::palette` `PalettePass`) — the **same recipes #3's golden
  self-verifies**, now on a live surface. Desktop `run()` + Android `android_main` entry points.
- **`Cargo.toml`:** `cdylib` (what cargo-apk packages) + winit/android-native-activity +
  android_logger; **`[package.metadata.android]` package id `dev.brickmap.goblingold`** — **DISTINCT**
  from the `scraped-again` engine demo AND the halves Capacitor `.exp` (three separate apps, install
  side by side). Signed with the committed `release.keystore`.
- **`.github/workflows/android.yml`:** now a **matrix** over `{scraped-again, goblin-gold}` — each
  builds its own signed arm64 APK, uploads a **workflow artifact**, and publishes to the rolling
  **`dev` prerelease** (pruning only its own prefix, so the two coexist). *(This is how scraped-again
  ships — "built blind in CI, the human installs + verifies on a phone".)*
- **Local verification (no NDK here, so the APK binary is CI-built):** native **and**
  `aarch64-linux-android` `cargo check` + `clippy -D warnings` both clean; `fmt` + tests green; #3's
  GPU golden still passes under lavapipe. **CI Android build triggered on the `main` push** → the
  signed `goblin-gold-<sha>-android-arm64.apk` lands as the run artifact + on the `dev` release.
- **Deliverable for the owner:** install **`dev.brickmap.goblingold`** from the `dev` prerelease /
  the Android-APK workflow run, and **device-judge** the drill + keypad + FX fullscreen. **This is
  the FINAL spike gate → the full go/no-go decision (owner + Babysitter).** No engine/voxel code
  touched. **HOLD for the go/no-go.**

## BRICKMAP-GG1 spike — mini-gate #3: engine-native correct-answer FX + golden-PNG diff ([B], GO)

Babysitter gated #2→#3 (GO). Built the third mini-gate in `00-1/brickmap:crates/goblin-gold`
(commit `f0c6879`, pushed to `main` + the feature branch): a **correct-answer FX flourish** built
on brickmap's **OWN render recipes — NOT a port of the web `fxgl.js`** — and **asserted by a
headless golden-PNG diff that is itself proven to catch a regression**.
- **The flourish (`fx.rs`):** a **gold spark burst** from the engine's CPU
  `bm-render::particles::ParticleSystem` (its gravity/lifetime/fade), composited over the answer,
  then the whole frame recoloured by the engine's **palette-dither post**
  `bm-render::palette::PalettePass` — Bayer-4×4 luminance map over a curated gold ramp. On a
  correct answer the screen blooms into dithered gold with a shower of bright flecks (the
  engine-native "expose the tech" look). **Deterministic** (fixed seed + fixed sim slice) so it
  renders pixel-stably.
- **Golden-diff (`headless.rs`, renamed from `render.rs`):** the `Painter` gains `paint_palettized`
  (scene → the engine palette pass → sRGB target → readback RGBA) + a **pure-CPU golden layer**
  (`rgba_from_png`/`diff`/`matches`) so the *comparator runs in CI without a GPU*.
- **Test the test (`tests/golden.rs`):** (1) **pure / CI-safe** — loads the committed golden and
  proves the comparator catches an injected tint (teeth, no GPU); (2) **`#[ignore]` GPU (lavapipe)**
  — re-renders the FX moment, asserts it **matches** the golden, AND asserts the **two injected
  regressions** (burst suppressed / palette collapsed to one tone) **FAIL** the match. Both pass.
- **Evidence:** `fx_proto` renders the FX moment + the two regression frames; `GG_BLESS=1`
  (re)writes the committed golden (`tests/goldens/fx-correct.png`, ~12 KB; full-frame dither but the
  periodic Bayer compresses well). FX screenshot delivered to the owner.
- CI-parity green: `fmt` + `clippy -D warnings` (**workspace-wide**) + tests (14 pure pass; GPU
  golden passes under lavapipe). No engine/voxel code touched — `bm-render` consumed as a
  dependency, not modified. The `Painter` + palette/particle usage is the reusable engine-candidate
  UI/FX surface.
- **HOLD for the Babysitter to gate → #4 clean APK (the final spike gate — owner device-judges).**
  *(Heads-up for #4: halves `main` carries the `T231` Capacitor scaffold — relevant to reconciling
  the APK path.)*

## BRICKMAP-GG1 spike — mini-gate #2: keypad + one drill over the T229 DATA SEAM ([B], GO)

Babysitter gated #1→#2 (GO). Built the second mini-gate in `00-1/brickmap:crates/goblin-gold`
(commit `227c5e8`, pushed to `main` + the feature branch): an **on-screen numeric keypad** plus a
**single-topic drill loop**, with the questions **consumed from T229's content data seam**
(`data/gg1/{modes.json,parity-vectors.json}`, one-way synced) — so the cross-repo **DATA seam is
proven end to end** (research §"share DATA, not code").
- **Drill (`drill.rs`):** `Drill::from_seam(mode)` reads the mode **name/tag from `modes.json`** and
  the **`{p,a}` questions from `parity-vectors.json`**. The JS `transform` is **never executed** —
  the parity vectors ARE the correctness contract. `press`/`submit` mark **right/wrong**; a correct
  answer advances. **The seam IS the test:** a unit test types **every** halves vector's expected
  answer (incl. `.5` decimals) and asserts each is accepted (27/27), plus a wrong answer is marked
  Wrong + doesn't advance, and a *second* topic (`times`, with `×` prompts) loads — proving it's
  data-driven, not hardcoded. **CI-green, no GPU.**
- **Keypad (`keypad.rs`):** a **data-free** 3-col widget (`1-9 / . 0 ⌫ / Enter` bar) — layout +
  hit-test + char-mapping, **no game/topic literals** (honours the one-way no-leakage rule, so it
  sinks into `bm-render` later). Engine-candidate.
- **Painter (`render.rs`):** a small reusable headless 2-D painter (flat rects + AA text) through the
  **real wgpu path** — the engine-candidate UI surface; `font_proto` was refactored onto it.
- **Evidence:** the `drill_proto` bin drives the **real model + keypad layout** and snapshots three
  screen states to PNG via lavapipe — **mid-entry** (neutral), **correct** (green "50" / "Correct!" /
  1·27), **wrong** (red "99" / "Try again"). The framed question reads **"Half of 100"** — drawn
  straight from the first parity vector (`100→50`), i.e. the seam is *visibly* live. Same wgpu
  pipeline as web/APK; owner does the final on-phone eyeball. (Backspace renders as `<` — the
  documented ASCII fallback, since the embedded face lacks `⌫`.)
- CI-parity green: `fmt` + `clippy -D warnings` + all tests (9) pass; no engine/voxel code touched.
- Keypad+drill screenshots delivered to the owner. **HOLD for the Babysitter to gate → #3 golden-PNG
  FX · #4 clean APK.**

## BRICKMAP-GG1 spike — mini-gate #1: legible font path PROVEN ([B], GO)

Owner approved the spike (font prototype-first). Built `00-1/brickmap:crates/goblin-gold` (commit
`5bf7ef0`) — the spike crate's first piece: a `text` core that bakes a TrueType face (Instrument
Sans, OFL) to an **anti-aliased grayscale coverage atlas** + word-wraps prose, and a `font_proto`
bin that renders a real GG **guide + question screen** through the **actual wgpu path** (offscreen,
software-Vulkan/llvmpipe) at phone reading sizes → PNG.
- **Verdict: clear YES — the #1 blocker is cleared.** Crisp, fully legible reading-size prose at
  28 / 34 / 42 px on a 1080-wide phone canvas (gold heading + question, light guide paragraph) —
  categorically better than brickmap's `font8x8` 8×8 bitmap for guide/explain text. Same wgpu
  pipeline as web/APK, so on-device pixels match; owner does the final on-phone eyeball.
- The atlas→`R8` texture + textured-quad draw is the proven `bm-render::hud` pattern; this later
  sinks into `bm-render` as the engine's reusable text service (per owner "bank reusable text").
- CI-parity green: pure-CPU unit tests (AA bake + wrap) pass without a GPU; `clippy -D warnings` +
  `fmt` clean; no engine/voxel code touched. Charset = printable ASCII for the prototype (extend later).
- Evidence (phone-size prose screenshots) delivered to the owner. **HOLD for the Babysitter to gate
  → #2 keypad+drill (T229 data seam) · #3 golden-PNG FX · #4 clean APK.**

## BRICKMAP-GG1 — port research pass ([B], strand 3, research-only)

GG1-on-brickmap research delivered → **`00-1/brickmap:docs/gg1-port-research.md`** (commit `fb020fa`).
Verdict: feasible re-platform (not a port). GG1 is a 2-D text/UI/audio game → uses brickmap's
*presentation half* (overlays/palette/particles/text/audio/input), not the voxel half; FX is
"coming home" (`fxgl.js` was ported FROM `palette`/`splat` WGSL); audio DSP + cpal/web I/O already
exist; headless render-to-PNG works (golden-diff is the gap GG brings). New engine work: a legible
font path (SDF/TTF — the #1 dependency), a UI/menu/numeric-keypad layer, a save abstraction, a11y
(regression risk for schools). Reuse verdict: re-implement logic in Rust vs T229 parity vectors,
re-author audio onto the `Drone`-style synth, use `bm-render` recipes directly — **do NOT embed JS**.
Includes a capability matrix, GG1→brickmap subsystem map, proposed `crates/goblin-gold` boundary,
and a scoped spike (crisp text + one drill + self-verified FX + clean APK) ≈13–21 eng-days + a
go/no-go gate. No engine/game code changed. Babysitter writes `BRICKMAP-GG1-SPEC.md` next.

## T103 — low-end-Android PERF pass: audit + fix the render hot paths ([B], owner-mandated)

Owner: the perf pass "is not optional." A measure-and-fix pass for Adreno-618/Poco-X3-class Android
(installed PWA) now that the home backdrop animates continuously. Audited the live `fxgl.js` hot
paths and **applied the cheap fixes**; the rest is a doc + an owner on-device plan
(`docs/PERF-RESEARCH-2.md`). Headline finding + fixes:
- **Burst overlay re-rasterised the STATIC pile every frame** (the worst path): `_syncOverlay`
  called `drawHoard` (~16–22k `fillRect`) **per frame** for the whole ~1–2 s shower, ×refresh-rate.
  Fix: a **cached offscreen pile bitmap** (`_pileBitmap`, keyed on size/scale/level/seed) rendered
  **once** and **blitted** (`drawImage`) each burst frame — measured **~22,031 `fillRect`/frame →
  one `drawImage`/frame** (pixel-identical output; flying coins still draw, they're the only moving
  part). The ≈full-screen cache is **freed on burst end + dispose** (no idle memory). Capability-
  gated → falls back to the direct draw on old engines / test stubs.
- **High-refresh cap:** the per-frame burst **overlay** composite is capped to **~60 Hz** (the GL
  scene still renders every RAF) so a 90/120 Hz panel doesn't double the 2D cost.
- **Audited-good (documented, no change):** the T207 pile sparkle is already coin-only + 5 Hz
  throttled (~12–24k `fillRect/s`, in budget); idle/off-home cost ~0 (`stop()` idles the RAF +
  T211 hides the overlay); reduced-motion runs no loop; one app-lifetime `Controller` → no
  per-navigation listener leak; degrade ladder (WebGPU→WebGL2→Canvas2D-still, quality tiers,
  particle caps) intact; single GL context.

Verify: `node -c` clean; **fxgl 146** (+11 T103 assertions — burst pile cached/blitted not
re-rasterised, cache invalidates on wealth change + frees; GL renders every RAF while the overlay
is capped to ~60 Hz; stopped + reduced-motion controllers schedule NO frames); full Node suite
green (golden-fx 116 / fx-wiring 84 / hoard-wiring 47 / synth 177 / emblems 34); render/visual/audio
gates green; the cached burst renders identically on WebGL2. B-led (`fxgl.js`, `docs/PERF-RESEARCH-2.md`,
`test/fxgl.test.js`). **Owner runs the on-device plan** (jank/battery/heat); any `main.js` perf
follow-ups the audit surfaces are split out to [A].

## T211 — BUG: the gold hoard showed behind EVERY screen → overlay now follows the backdrop ([B], 🔴 owner-reported)

Owner: *"gold stacks behind every screen, but I only want it on the main screen."* Root cause: the
hoard renders on a separate **overlay canvas** (`.fxgl-hoard`, `_hoardCv`, T185) whose className
**strips `hidden`** (so it's never `display:none` — the T133/T185 reason). `[A]`'s screen router
calls `fxBg.stop()` + hides `#fxBackdrop` on non-home/arena screens, but only toggles `hidden` on
the **scene canvas** — the overlay sibling lingered, still showing the last home hoard behind
Inventory/Heroes/Setup. Fix (`fxgl.js`, [B]-only — the overlay owns its own visibility):
- New `_showOverlay(on)`: `visibility:hidden` + `clearRect` when off, reveal when on (kept as
  **visibility**, not `display:none`, so it stays drawable).
- **`stop()` → `_showOverlay(false)`** (backdrop off → hide + clear the pile); **`start()` →
  `_showOverlay(true)`** (home/arena re-show; `setData`/`_syncOverlay` then repaint the right
  content — Arena has no hoard so it draws empty). So the pile shows **only** where the scene does.
- 🌐 **Browser-verified in the real app** (gold=1e9): home → overlay `visible`; navigate to
  `#/audio` → `hidden`; back home → `visible`; no JS errors.

Verify: `node -c` clean; **golden-fx 116** (+4 T211 assertions — overlay visible on the live
backdrop, `stop()` hides + clears it, `start()` re-shows it); full Node suite green (fxgl 135 /
fx-wiring 84 / hoard-wiring 47); render/visual/audio gates green; backdrop/burst behaviour
unaffected. B-only (`fxgl.js`, `test/golden-fx.test.js`). Owner device-confirms.

## T207 — coin SHINE: glints on the shower + occasional pile sparkles + clearer rotation ([B], owner-requested)

Owner: *"occasional glints in the pile of coins; glints on the shower of coins; ideally some
showered coins would also rotate."* All in `fxgl.js`:
- **Specular glint in `drawCoin`** (pixel path): a new `hi` (0..1) flashes the brightest face cells
  near the lit pole to a near-white-gold specular tone (`shade(rgb,0.78)`), the flash growing with
  `hi` — a small sparkle, not the whole face. Gated (none at `hi=0`); the glint cells stay WITHIN
  the coin face so a glint-off redraw fully restores it (needed for the cheap pile pass).
- **Shower glints (`drawCoinParticle`):** passes `hi = p.shine · max(0, cos(lt·wob + phase))` — so
  each flying coin flashes as it turns face-on, varied per coin by `p.shine` (seeded in `seedBurst`,
  0 under reduced-motion) → they don't sparkle in unison.
- **Clearer rotation:** `seedBurst` coin `spin` is now `lerp(3,20, rng·rng)·±1` (skewed) — most
  coins tumble briskly, some barely, so the spin reads clearly + varied instead of a uniform blur.
- **Pile sparkles (`_pileGlint`, throttled ~5 Hz from `_frame`):** the settled pile is a static
  still by design, so this repaints ONLY the coins (opaque → they restore the previous tick's
  glints in place; the silhouette is never redrawn → cheap) with a **sparse, per-coin time-phased**
  flash (`sin(t·2.4 + coin.glint·3.1) > 0.985` → only a handful peak at once, cycling). Gated to
  the GL/GPU overlay + ambient loop + not-bursting; **reduced-motion / CPU-still stay static**.
  (Perf: ~a few k fillRects/s; the upcoming T103 perf pass is the budget gate — if it flags, the
  repaint can shrink to just the glinting subset.)
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on WebGL2**: bright sparkle flecks across the shower coins; occasional
  cycling sparkles on the settled pile (`shine-t207-shower.png`, `shine-t207-pile-{a,b}.png`).

Verify: `node -c` clean; **golden-fx 112** (+12 T207 assertions — glint→specular cells gated on
`hi` + a small sparkle (teeth); shower coins carry varied `shine` + varied `spin` + none when
reduced; `_pileGlint` repaints coins WITHOUT a full clear, is deterministic, CYCLES across time,
and is a no-op under reduced-motion); full Node suite green (fxgl 135 / fx-wiring 84 / hoard-wiring
47 / synth 177 / emblems 34); render/visual/audio gates green; scenes byte-identical when no hoard
(drawCoin `hi` defaults to 0). B-only (`fxgl.js`, `test/golden-fx.test.js`). Owner device-confirms.

## T205 — trim emblems to the 3 creatures + fix their sizing (fill the cell) ([B], owner-requested)

Owner: *"the final 3 emblems are nice — the rest we can scrap … in the emblems screen they look
like they need cropping."* Magnar (`hero:mo`, T194) is the launcher icon now, so the 6 abstract
marks are gone and the 3 creatures become Collector awards (T206 [A]). In `emblems.js`:
- **Scrapped 6, kept 3:** `IDS = ["beast","goblinking","voidbeast"]`; removed the
  `coin`/`crowncoin`/`hoard`/`goblin`/`voidthrone`/`sigil` generators and the now-unused
  `disc`/`stampProfile` helpers. (`creature()`/`mulberry`/`setSym` retained.)
- **Sizing fix (the "needs cropping" tell):** `draw()` no longer maps the full 24² grid (which
  left the creature small + off-centre with dead margin); it now fits the **subject's content
  bounding box** — scales the lit-cell bbox to fill the available square (`cell = round(avail/
  span)`, integer → crisp), **centred**, with a ~10% safe margin. So each creature **fills the
  cell**, nothing clipped, no dead margin, and all 3 read the **same visual size** → they match
  the other Collector-award icons.
- Removed the 6 orphaned `emblem_*` goldens; the 3 kept creatures' cell goldens are unchanged
  (`creature()` untouched).
- 🌐 Rendered the 3 at icon size: centred, horns/eyes fully in-frame, uniform fill (`emblems-t205.png`).

Verify: `node -c` clean; **emblems 34** (IDS===3, the 6 marks gone + `cells()` null, each creature
fills ≥78% / within 12% of each other / uncropped with a margin every side, corners field/maskable);
the 3 creature cell-goldens green. B-only (`emblems.js`, `test/emblems.test.js`, golden cleanup).
Pairs with T206 [A] (consumes these as awards). Owner reviews.

## T204 — BUG: purple backdrop lost on PWA app-switch → WebGL context-loss SELF-HEAL ([B], 🔴 owner-reported)

Owner screenshot: backgrounding the PWA sometimes leaves a **light-grey home** (the dark-purple
backdrop gone; the hoard pile still drew — it's on the separate 2D overlay). Root cause: the OS
frees the WebGL context on app-switch and `fxgl` had **no `webglcontextlost/restored` handling** —
a lost canvas presents ~white, and `.fx-backdrop`'s `opacity:.85` over the `#0E1116` body = light
grey. Fixed in `fxgl.js` (self-listening, [B]-only):
- **`_attachLifecycle`** (wired in the ctor) registers `webglcontextlost`/`webglcontextrestored`
  on the canvas + `visibilitychange` on document (guarded for headless/no-listener envs).
- **On LOSS** (`_handleContextLost`): `preventDefault()` (so the browser will restore), mark
  not-ready, **cancel the RAF** (no drawing into a dead context), and **hide the canvas**
  (`visibility:hidden`) so the **dark brand body shows — never the white/grey flash** (the safety
  net that alone kills the jarring light state).
- **On RESTORE** (`_handleContextRestored`): re-acquire the backend (`_init` → fresh GL context +
  program), which re-uploads (`setData`), re-fits, redraws, and resumes the loop; reveal the canvas.
- **On FOREGROUND** (`visibilitychange`→visible): `redraw()` (refit + repaint + overlay sync) for
  a throttled/paused-tab blank with no real loss; and if still flagged lost, **re-init as a
  backstop** — which also covers the **WebGPU `device.lost`** path (no restored event there; a
  `device.lost.then` hook flags it on loss).
- Exposed a public **`redraw()`** so an [A] foreground hook can also trigger it. `dispose` removes
  all three listeners (no leak).
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on WebGL2** via `WEBGL_lose_context`: before ready/visible → on
  `loseContext()` not-ready + canvas hidden (dark, no white) → on `restoreContext()` ready/visible
  again + scene redrawn; no JS errors.

Verify: `node -c` clean; **fxgl 135** (+11 T204 assertions — listeners registered, loss→not-ready
+ hidden + RAF cancelled + preventDefault, restore→re-init + re-upload + revealed, foreground
repaint w/o re-upload, teeth: a loss with no restore never sits white + the foreground re-init
backstop); full Node suite green (golden-fx 100 / fx-wiring 84 / synth 177 / hoard-wiring 47);
render/visual/audio gates green. B-only (`fxgl.js`, `test/fxgl.test.js`). Owner device-confirms

## T203 — coin-shower POLISH: slightly bigger + rain DOWN (more gravity, less fly-up) ([B], owner-reported)

Owner on the now-approved shower: *"looks pretty good — but make them slightly bigger, and give
them more gravity, more falling down, less flying up."* Tuned the **money-gain coin shower** (the
`look:"coin"` branch of `seedBurst`) only — the generic confetti is untouched. In `fxgl.js`:
- **Less fly-up:** the coin launch vertical velocity is suppressed (`sin(ang)·spd·0.3`) with only a
  **gentle pop** (`coinUp` 0.10 vs the confetti 0.42 fountain) → gravity dominates, they rain down.
- **More gravity (NOT global):** `BURST_GRAVITY` is a shared shader uniform, so instead each coin
  carries `p.grav = BURST_GRAVITY·1.9`, plumbed through **`drawCoinParticle`'s `burstPos`** — the
  path ALL coins render through on every backend (overlay + CPU still). The shader splat (confetti
  only) is untouched. **[B]-only**, no shader change.
- **Slightly bigger:** the coin `sizeRange` bumped ~+20% (6→7 / 12→15).
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on WebGL2**: fired from y=0.30, the bigger coins spread and drop below the
  launch point within ~170ms — raining down, not fountaining up (`shower-t203-webgl.png`).

Verify: `node -c` clean; **golden-fx 100** (+6 T203 assertions — coins bigger than confetti,
much less upward launch, 80/80 sink below the launch point under their gravity, `p.grav >
BURST_GRAVITY` while confetti has none, the coin gravity falls faster via `burstPos`, teeth: the
confetti still fountains up at its small size); full Node suite green (fxgl 124 / fx-wiring 84 /
hoard-wiring 47); amount-scaling (T173) preserved. B-only (`fxgl.js`, `test/golden-fx.test.js`).

## T200 — coin COLOUR by height: dark gold low, light gold high (with a mix at each level) ([B], owner-reported)

Owner: *"too much of a mix of dark/light coins — lower down should be more dark, higher up more
light, with some of each still mixed in."* `seedHoard` picked each tone ~uniformly at random → a
flat salt-and-pepper mix. Fixed in `fxgl.js`:
- The gold pool is ordered **dark→light by luminance** (`toneRamp`), and each coin's tone is
  picked by its **fill-rank `q`** (T196): `pick = clamp01(q + (rng()−0.5)·0.9)` → index into the
  ramp. Low/deep coins weight DARK, high/crest coins weight LIGHT, and the ±0.45 jitter keeps a
  **mix of both at every level** (a gradient of the *distribution*, not a hard split). Reinforces
  the silhouette's own crest-light→base-dark shading.
- Keyed off `q` (level-independent) and one rng draw → a coin's tone is **stable as the pile
  grows** (no flicker; prefix-identical with T196) and the scatter geometry is byte-identical.
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on WebGL2**: paler gold at the crests, darker specks toward the base,
  mixed throughout (`hoard-halftone-webgl.png`).

Verify: `node -c` clean; **golden-fx 94** (+4 T200 assertions — base mean-luma < crest by >0.05,
≥2 tones in each band (mix retained), tone stable across pile growth, teeth: top-decile markedly
lighter than bottom-decile Δluma>0.08); full Node suite green (fxgl 124 / hoard-wiring 47 /
fx-wiring 84); `fx_hoard_scatter` golden unchanged (sample is geometry, not colour). B-only

## T199 — a maxed pile reaches the TOP of the screen (1T left a gap) ([B], owner-reported)

Owner: *"1T still doesn't fill the screen — better than before though."* T192 raised `HOARD_MAX_H`
to 0.82, so a level-1.0 pile climbed ~82% and stopped short of the ceiling. Fixed in `fxgl.js`:
- **`HOARD_MAX_H` 0.82 → 1.0** so a level-1.0 pile can fill the screen.
- **`moundProfile` wall-banking** nudged (`0.42 → 0.44` base, wall term `0.58`) and the organic
  drift/roughness **tapered toward the walls** (`taper = 1 − 0.7·wall`) — so the banked sides climb
  **cleanly to the top** (≥~0.95 across seeds) while the **centre keeps its organic dip** (~0.44),
  reading as a banked container, not a flat lid. (Without the taper, drift could pull a wall off
  the ceiling.)
- Interaction with the [A] fill-curve recurve (T198): once that lands, **level 1.0 = the top of the
  economy** (not 1T), so 1T reads tall-but-not-full and only peak wealth fills the screen — intended;
  T199 just makes level 1.0 *able* to fill it. Stays behind the UI (partial occlusion is fine).
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on WebGL2** at level 1.0: gold banks up BOTH walls to the top edge with a
  centre valley (`hoard-halftone-webgl.png`), halftone + pixel-dithered coins intact.

Verify: `node -c` clean; **golden-fx 90** (+3 T199 assertions — `HOARD_MAX_H ≥ 0.95`, walls ≥0.88
at level 1.0 across seeds, centre still dips below the walls; `fx_hoard_scatter` re-blessed —
only `maxH` 0.82→1); full Node suite green (fxgl 124 / hoard-wiring 47 / fx-wiring 84); scenes

## T197 — pixelate + dither the COINS too (T195 filtered only the pile shape) ([B], owner-reported)

Owner on the T195 build: *"the shape got a filter but not the coins themselves — pixelate the
coins too."* (And: *"the colour is ok, ignore that"* → **NO colour shift.**) T195's halftone ran
on the silhouette only; the cylinder coins (`drawCoin` + the gain-burst `drawCoinParticle`) were
smooth canvas ellipse fills that bypassed the ramp + Bayer, so they read smooth against the
dithered pile. Fixed in `fxgl.js`:
- **`drawCoin` gains a PIXEL-DITHER path** (engaged when a `cell` is passed): it rasterises the
  cylinder into the **same screen cell-grid as the T195 pile** (`cell = round(pxScale·3)`,
  pixel-snapped, nearest-neighbour, crisp) and ordered-Bayer-dithers (`rampIndex`/`bayer4`,
  spread 1) between the coin's **OWN three tones** — edge `shade(rgb,-0.4)` → face `rgb` →
  highlight `shade(rgb,0.42)`. A soft upper-left face light gives a real gradient for the dither
  to work on. **No colour shift** (only the coin's existing tones), and **no canvas read-back**
  → cheap enough for the per-frame gain-burst coins. The smooth/vector + path-less fallbacks stay
  for callers/tests that pass no `cell`.
- Both call sites pass the **shared `cell`**: the static hoard coins (`drawHoard`) and the
  animated gain-burst coins (`drawCoinParticle`) — so silhouette + settled coins + flying coins
  all share one dot lattice.
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on WebGL2**: the pile and coins now read as one cohesive pixel-dithered
  gold field — no smooth ellipses standing out (`hoard-halftone-crop.png`, `coinburst-webgl.png`).

Verify: `node -c` clean; **golden-fx 87** (+5 T197 assertions — the coin rasterises into many
cell-aligned fills, dithers ≥2 of its tones, every tone is one of its OWN 3 (no colour shift),
teeth: no-`cell` keeps the smooth ellipse path); full Node suite green (fxgl 124 / hoard-wiring
47 / fx-wiring 84 / synth 177 / emblems 61); render/visual/audio gates green; scenes byte-

## T193 (RE-OPEN) — the money-gain burst tagged no coins → fixed `seedBurst`/`seedCelebrate` to honor `look:"coin"` ([B], CHANGES REQUESTED)

Babysitter re-opened (my earlier renderer was correct but never fired): the live money-gain
shower is **`burst({look:"coin"})` → `seedBurst`**, and `seedBurst` (and `seedCelebrate`) **never
read `opts.look`** — so particles were never tagged `look:1`, `_ignite`'s router sent them to the
shader splat, and they rendered as **squares** on the owner's device (owner: "still no coins,
unchanged"). `drawCoinParticle` + the overlay routing (T193) were fine but received no coin-tagged
particles. Fix in `fxgl.js`:
- **`seedBurst`/`seedCelebrate` now honor `opts.look === "coin"`:** each particle gets `look:1`
  plus the spin fields `drawCoinParticle` animates (`rot`/`spin`/`wob`/`phase`), and the colour
  pool defaults to the **gold ramp** (`GOLD_TONES`) when no palette is given. The coin's extra
  rng draws live **only** inside the `if(coin)` branch → the default-confetti seed sequence (and
  `fx_burst`/`fx_celebrate` goldens) are **byte-identical**. Coins are ballistic (no converge
  target) so `drawCoinParticle` flies them on `burstPos`.
- The existing `_ignite` routing already keeps coins in `burst_.parts` while sending only
  `look!==1` confetti to the GL splat, and `_syncOverlay` draws the `look===1` coins as spinning
  cylinders on the 2D overlay — so the fix lights up on every backend incl. the device.
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on WebGL2**: `burst({look:"coin"})` with no hoard throws spinning
  cell-shaded cylinder coins on the overlay (`burst-coin-webgl.png`), not squares.

Why the suite missed it (now gated): no test asserted the **seeding path** tagged coins.
Added the gate — **golden-fx 82** (+7 T193-re-open assertions: `seedBurst({look:'coin'})` tags
every particle `look:1` + carries varied spin fields + defaults to gold + stays ballistic; the
default burst is still plain confetti (`look` unset); and `burst({look:'coin'})` on a GL backend
routes ONLY confetti to the splat while keeping coins for the overlay). `node -c` clean; full
Node suite green (fxgl 124 / hoard-wiring 47 / fx-wiring 84 / synth 177 / emblems 61);
render/visual/audio gates green; confetti goldens unchanged. B-only (`fxgl.js`,
`test/golden-fx.test.js`, `test/browser/coinburst-capture.js`). Owner device-confirms (force-
refresh the PWA). **Next B: T197 (dither the coins) → T199 → T200.**

## T196 — hoard rises GRADUALLY: ~100+ fine height levels via STABLE ACCUMULATION ([B], owner-reported)

Owner: *"more gradations of pile HEIGHT — not just 8, maybe 100. The user should see it gradually
rise as wealth increases, not big jumps."* Root cause: `deriveHomeScene` keyed the coin-buffer
**seed off an 8-tier quantiser** (`hoardTier`), so a whole wealth band showed the same pile then
jumped — and the seed change **reshuffled every coin** (teleport). Fixed in `fxgl.js` (the
re-seed trap avoided — a naïve `HOARD_TIERS=100` would reshuffle ~100×):
- **`seedHoard` is now a STABLE ACCUMULATION.** Each coin's place is fixed by its **fill-rank**
  `q = (i+0.5)/full`, where `full` = the level-1 coin count (depends on cap/reduced, **NOT** the
  current level). A coin sits at the surface height of **its own rank** (`moundProfile(x, q)`),
  and size scales with `q` — both level-independent. Raising `level` only raises `n =
  round(full·level)`, i.e. **appends higher-rank coins on top**. So `seedHoard(lowLevel)` is a
  **byte-identical PREFIX** of `seedHoard(highLevel)` — existing coins never move; the pile
  builds upward in ~`full` (≈480) fine steps.
- **`deriveHomeScene` uses a FIXED seed** (`scene.seed ^ 0x601d`) — the 8-tier seed keying is
  gone, so the field is stable across earns (no teleport) and the continuous `lvl` drives a
  smooth rise. The silhouette (`moundProfile(x, level)`) was already continuous.
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on WebGL2**: the same hoard at levels 0.15 / 0.4 / 0.65 / 0.9 builds
  upward smoothly — each lower pile is visibly a sub-pile of the higher (`hoard-rise-strip.png`).

Verify: `node -c` clean; **golden-fx 75** (+5 T196 assertions — prefix/no-teleport, **101**
distinct counts across 1%-level steps = ~100 levels, fills-upward, stable home seed; teeth on
all; `fx_hoard_scatter` re-blessed — rank-0 coin now sits at the base y≈100 not the old crest);
full Node suite green (fxgl 124 / hoard-wiring 47 / fx-wiring 84 / synth 177 / emblems 61);
render/visual/audio gates green. B-only (`fxgl.js`, `test/golden-fx.test.js`, golden). Owner
device-confirms the gradual rise.

## T195 — hoard FILTER pass: render the pile in brickmap's halftone-dither look (shading only) ([B], owner-reported)

Owner on the T192 pile: *"needs a filter pass — dithering and pixelation, along the lines of
brickmap."* The whole scene already renders with ordered-Bayer dither + palette quantise, but
`drawHoard` was the ONE part still drawing a **smooth analog gradient** (`shade(base, 0.25 −
depth·0.6)`) — so the pile read smooth against the dithered/halftone scene. Fixed in `fxgl.js`
(SHADING only — the height-gradation is the separate T196):
- **`drawHoard` silhouette** now uses the **same machinery the scene uses** (`rampIndex` +
  `bayer4`, my exact port of brickmap `palette.wgsl`): a crest-light→base-dark **luminance/depth
  gradient-map** posterised onto a **curated 5-stop gold ramp** (`hoardRamp`/`HOARD_SHADES`),
  with the **ordered Bayer 4×4 dot pattern between stops** (the halftone) at a **chunky pixel
  scale** (`cell = round(pxScale·3)`, nearest-neighbour, crisp) — NO smooth gradient. A touch of
  position-hashed variation breaks dead-flat bands. The cell-shaded cylinder coins sit on top
  unchanged, cohesive in the halftone field.
- The dot lattice is a pure function of integer big-pixel coords → **screen-locked**, stable
  across frames, dot-locked to the biome behind it. Same draw on the WebGL/WebGPU 2D overlay
  (the device) AND the CPU still.
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on WebGL2** (`test/browser/hoard-capture.js` → `screenshots/hoard-halftone-{webgl,crop}.png`):
  the pile is a crisp ordered-Bayer halftone, posterised gold, dot-locked to the dithered scene.

Verify: `node -c` clean; **golden-fx 70** (+6 new T195 assertions — silhouette posterised to ≤
the 5-stop ramp, every tone drawn from the curated gold ramp, ramp luma-ascending + gold-family,
teeth: the old smooth gradient would blow past the ramp's 5 tones); full Node suite green (fxgl
124 / synth 177 / emblems 61); render 7 / visual 13 / audio 27 + hoard-wiring 47 green; scenes
byte-identical when no hoard. B-only (`fxgl.js`, `test/golden-fx.test.js`, `test/browser/hoard-capture.js`).
Owner device-confirms. **T196 next** (gradual height — ~100 levels via stable accumulation).

## T193 — money-gain celebration: SPINNING cell-shaded cylinder coins on every backend ([B], reuses the T192 coin)

The earn burst now throws **real spinning coins**, not shader-splat discs — the same
cell-shaded cylinder primitive as the T192 hoard, so a gain visibly rains the *same gold*
onto the *same pile*. All in `fxgl.js` + B-owned tests:
- **`seedConverge` coins** carry `spin`, `wob`, `phase` (per-particle, seeded) so each coin
  tumbles independently: `rot += lt·spin`, `aspect = 0.22 + 0.72·|cos(lt·wob + phase)|`
  (face-on → edge-on → face-on as it flips). Amount-scaling (count/spread) is preserved.
- **`drawCoinParticle`** animates one coin along its `convergePos`/`burstPos` arc with the
  live spin, alpha-faded by the particle's life — shared by the CPU still AND the overlay.
- **Per-particle ROUTING (the crux):** coin-look particles (`look===1`) are drawn as
  cylinders on the backend-agnostic **2D overlay** (T185) for the WebGL/WebGPU backends and
  inline by the CPU still; the GL/GPU **splat receives ONLY non-coin confetti**
  (`parts.filter(p => p.look !== 1)`). Mobile refuses a 2nd GL context (T133/T138), so coins
  *must* ride the 2D overlay to show on the device. `_syncHoard`→**`_syncOverlay(burstTime)`**
  now composites the static hoard + the active coin burst each frame, and clears the spent
  coins (leaving the hoard) on auto-stop.
- 🌐 **Browser-verified on the WebGL2 backend** (headless Chromium, dpr 2.75): coins arc from
  the earn-point, tumble, and converge onto the wall-banked hoard; overlay measured lit;
  no JS errors. Capture: `test/browser/coinburst-capture.js` →
  `screenshots/coinburst-webgl{,-early,-late}.png`.

Verify: `node -c` clean; **golden-fx 64** (T185 overlay test moved to `_syncOverlay`; **+2
new T193 assertions** — a no-hoard earn burst paints cylinder fills on the GL overlay, and
the GL splat gets only `look!==1`); full Node suite green (fxgl 124 / synth 177 / emblems
61); render 7 / visual 13 / audio 27 browser gates green. B-only (`fxgl.js`, `test/golden-fx.test.js`,
`test/browser/coinburst-capture.js`). Owner device-confirms.

## T192 — hoard overhaul: cell-shaded CYLINDER coins + a taller, wall-banked pile ([B], owner screenshot)

Owner's 3 notes on the live 1T hoard: (1) too low — should climb much higher; (2) not a
central dome — gold should bank against the side WALLS; (3) drop the beveled ovals →
cell-shaded short cylinders (face ≠ edge colour, no outline). All in `fxgl.js`:
- **New coin primitive (`drawCoin`):** a **cell-shaded rotated short CYLINDER** — a flat
  foreshortened top-face ellipse + a darker flat EDGE band below (the side), **two flat
  tones, NO outline, no gradient** (+ an optional tiny flat highlight). `aspect` tips it
  (face-on disc → edge-on bar), `rot` spins it. Same primitive for the hoard + (T193) the
  celebration. The path-less test raster gets a two-rect fallback (face + edge), still measurable.
- **Pile shape (`moundProfile`):** no more central dome — `0.42 + 0.50·wall^1.5 + drifts +
  roughness`, i.e. a **full-width fill that banks HIGHER against x≈0/1** with organic clumps,
  dipping in the middle (a heaping container). **`HOARD_MAX_H` 0.34 → 0.82** so at high
  wealth the walls climb most of the screen. **`HOARD_CAP` 340 → 480** + coin size grows
  with the pile → full, not sparse. `seedHoard` scatters **full-width** (mild wall bias).
- 🌐 **Browser-verified** at `?dev&gold=1e12`: gold banks thick up BOTH walls to near the
  top with a centre valley framing the UI; cylinder coins read; renders on the WebGL 2D
  overlay (the device) AND the CPU still.

Verify: `node -c` clean; `golden-fx` **62** (mound/pile assertions reframed for the
wall-bank + cylinder; `fx_hoard_scatter` re-blessed); existing non-hoard scenes byte-
identical; full Node suite + render/visual gates green. B-owned (`fxgl.js` + tests).
Owner device-confirms; **T193 next** (the earn celebration reuses the cylinder coin).

---

## T188 — character-forward creature/hero emblems in the bestiary style ([B], owner-requested)

Owner (after reviewing the live emblems): the abstract marks "could be useful," but
heroes/beasts are the best app-icon bet — do one more pass in the **bestiary generative
style**, into `emblems.js`. Added **3 character-forward creature candidates** (kept the
original 6): **`beast`** (horned, multi-eye gold brute), **`goblinking`** (a crowned
goblin-king bust), **`voidbeast`** (a smooth cosmic head with 3 purple eyes).

Re-implemented the `monsters.js` LOOK **self-contained** (no Monsters import — `emblems.js`
stays a pure, dep-free `cells(id)`→`draw` module like `glyphs.js`): a `creature(g,seed,opts)`
generator draws a lumpy, vertically-symmetric blob (gold-shaded upper-left→lower-right via
the same light dir as the coin bevel), horns/antennae or a smooth/crowned head, glinting
eyes (white or cosmic-purple), shadow teeth + spots, a dark outline ring, feet stubs —
deterministic from the seed. Bold, centred, **maskable** (full-bleed violet field, 14% safe
margin, legible 48→512 px).

Verify: `node -c` clean; `emblems.test` now **9 emblems** (the new ids are golden-pinned +
asserted non-empty/deterministic/gold-ramp/maskable by the IDS loop, + an explicit
character-forward check); full Node suite green. New goldens `emblem_{beast,goblinking,
voidbeast}`. B-owned (`emblems.js` + test). **[A]:** they auto-appear in Codex ▸ Emblems;
owner picks the launcher from the now-9 candidates.

## T191 — declick the engine-wide crackle/popping ([B], owner-reported, low-severity)

Owner: "the audio can have some crackling/popping, not terrible though." Two safe,
textbook fixes for the named causes (envelope discontinuity + clipping-into-the-limiter):
- **True-zero release in `adsr`:** exponential ramps can't reach 0 (they stop at 1e-4), so
  added a tiny linear tail to **TRUE 0** before the voice is torn down → no end-of-note
  discontinuity. Applies to every music voice AND drum (all use `adsr`).
- **Soft limiter knee (0 → 6 dB):** the master limiter was a hard brickwall; hard-clamping
  transient peaks on dense styles is the most likely "engine-wide" crackle. A 6 dB knee
  rounds the limiting so busy sums compress gently instead of hard-clipping (still ratio 20
  @ LIMIT_DB — bounded, T175 stability via the reverb-return compressor + decay cap is
  untouched). Attack nudged 3→4 ms.

Verify: `node -c` clean; `synth.test` 176 (ADSR test updated for the declick tail);
`golden-synth` unchanged (scores are note events, not envelopes); the T175 real-audio
stability gate green (×2, stable); full Node suite + all 3 browser gates green. B-owned
(`synth.js` + tests). **Owner device-confirms** the crackle is gone (can't reproduce the
analog crackle headlessly; these are the standard, can't-regress declick fixes).

## T190 — Lo-Fi still dark/stressful: IMPLEMENT the research (major + resolve home) ([B], owner-reported)

Owner rejected the T183 "blind nudge" (it only lifted pitch/reverb, **left the mode minor**).
Implemented the Babysitter's cited research (`docs/agent/research-study-music.md`) into
`CONTEXTS.lofi` — the highest-impact levers:
- **Mode `dorian` → `mixolydian`** (major-family → lower-cortisol "happy/predictable", with
  the b7 keeping lo-fi soul; dorian/minor *was* the "dark" — the single biggest lever).
- **Progression `[0,5,3,4]` → `[0,5,3,0]`** (I–vi–IV–**I**) — now **resolves HOME** each loop
  instead of sitting on the subdominant (dissonance/non-resolution ≡ tension ≡ stress).
- **Lead `pluck` → new `croon`** — a soft, low-passed murmur (slow attack 0.045, cut 1.4 kHz,
  no resonance, light sustain) instead of the bright resonant ping (a sharp lead is an
  "orienting trigger" = stress). It murmurs, doesn't ping.
- Kept tempo 78, sparse density 0.24, root 55, reverb 0.32, the `padep` Rhodes bed + swing —
  still recognisably lo-fi, just warm/calm not minor/tense. `solve` (the in-game drill bed)
  inherits it.

Verify: `node -c` clean; **distinctness holds** (12 mutually distinct, ≥5 modes — dorian
retired, mixolydian shared with tropical but the scores differ, ≥10 tempos); **12 patches
all distinct** (croon added); `golden-synth` re-blessed (only `synth_score_lofi`); T175
stability holds (real-audio gate green). Full Node suite + all 3 browser gates green.
B-owned (`synth.js` + tests). Owner device-confirms it's no longer dark/stressful.

## T185 — the gold hoard was INVISIBLE on-device: only the CPU backend drew it ([B], 🔴 DO-FIRST)

Owner: 1T gold, no pile on home. Babysitter-verified root cause: T172 rendered the hoard
**only in `CPUBackend._still`**; the real device runs **WebGL2/WebGPU**, whose `setData`/
`renderFrame` ignore `derived.hoard` entirely → the mound + coins were never drawn (exactly
the "not displaying at all" the owner saw). This was the GL-vs-CPU risk I flagged on T172.

### Fix — a backend-agnostic 2D OVERLAY (the Babysitter's recommended option)
Extracted the hoard draw to a standalone **`drawHoard(ctx, hoard, W, H, pxScale)`** (CPU
still + the overlay share one identical 2D draw — the beveled mound + coins). The Controller
now composites the hoard on a **2D overlay canvas** for non-CPU backends (`_syncHoard` +
`_ensureHoardCanvas`): it dynamically creates a `<canvas>` sibling of the scene canvas,
copies its class/box (so it inherits `.fx-backdrop`: `position:fixed; inset:0; z-index:-1`)
minus `hidden`, `pointer-events:none`, inserted **just after** the backdrop → paints **over
the purple backdrop, under the UI** (the owner's "over the backdrop, behind the buttons").
Sized to the GL buffer + redrawn on `setScene`/resize; CPU still draws it inline (no overlay).
**No `index.html` change needed** — the Controller owns the overlay.

### Verify
- 🌐 **Browser-verified** (`?dev&gold=1e12` → home, dpr 2.75): the overlay canvas mounts
  (912×1973, `z-index:-1`, `position:fixed`) with a real gold pile (399 lower-half gold px;
  was 0). `node -c` clean; new headless test drives `_syncHoard` with a stub GL backend →
  asserts the overlay is created, sized to the GL buffer (780×1688), and the pile is drawn
  (7220 fills). Existing scenes byte-identical when `scene.hoard` is absent; full Node suite
  (incl. `fx-wiring` + `hoard-wiring`) + all 3 browser gates green. **B-owned** (`fxgl.js` +
  `test/golden-fx.test.js`).

## T183 — research: study-friendly music + brighten the dark/bassy `lofi` ([B], owner-feedback)

Owner: "audio switching sounds very good now; only the Lo-Fi Study is a bit dark/bassy —
research what's nice to study/be-tested to." Doc `docs/research-study-music.md` + the
concrete `CONTEXTS.lofi` revision.

Findings: focus/test music = lyric-free (✓), steady ~70–90 BPM (✓), low dynamic range (✓
T175), sparse (✓ 0.24), and **warm-but-BRIGHT** — brightness from **register + a clear low
end**, not a faster/edgier tempo or key. So "dark/bassy" is a register + low-weight + wash
problem, not the genre (dorian + a Rhodes bed is authentic lo-fi).

Revision (kept dorian / Rhodes `padep` / swing / light kit): **root 50→55** (+5 semis lifts
the whole bed out of the dark register — the biggest fix), **leadOct 1→2** (the pluck sings
brighter), **reverb 0.42→0.32** (clears the washy low-mid haze), tempo 76→78. `solve` (the
in-game test music) is a `lofi` alias → inherits it. The other calm contexts (menu ionian/
airy, ambient lydian/sparse) are already bright — no change.

Verify: `node -c` clean; **distinctness holds** (12 mutually distinct, ≥5 modes, ≥10
tempos); `golden-synth` re-blessed (only `synth_score_lofi` changed — the intended note
shift); **T175 stability holds** (real-audio gate green; padep + decay 0.66 + the lower
0.32 send → even less buildup-prone). Full Node suite + all 3 browser gates green. B-owned
(`synth.js` + tests). Babysitter re-measures stability; owner ears the brightness.

---

## T181 — `emblems.js`: generative brand emblems (app-icon candidates + Codex) ([B], owner-greenlit)

Owner: "do icon generation — into the Codex too; unchosen ones become unlockable." New
standalone B-owned module **`emblems.js`** (`window.Emblems = { IDS, cells(id), draw(canvas,
id,opts), PALETTE, BG }`) minting the brand-emblem candidates in the engine's generative
pixel/dither style — **gold-on-violet, centred + maskable-safe** (each works as a launcher
icon AND a Codex tile).

### Six candidates (the owner's five + one)
`coin` (fat beveled gold coin + goblin profile + glint — reuses the hoard coin look),
`crowncoin` (the coin in a 3-point crown), `hoard` (a glinting coin-mound), `goblin` (a
cheeky pixel goblin head clutching a coin), `voidthrone` (a cosmic-purple throne + gold at
its foot + star glints), and `sigil` (the brand "/" slash through a coin — mark-forward).

### How (mirrors glyphs.js — pure + deterministic)
Emblems are **generated**, not hand-painted: a 24² ink-code grid filled by distance-field
discs shaded by a fixed upper-left light (the metal bevel) + a glint, on a 3-stop gold ramp
(+ cosmic purple for the throne). `cells(id)` is pure/testable; `draw(canvas,id)` is the only
side-effect — full-bleed violet field, the grid fit + **centred with a ~14% maskable margin**
(the subject never relies on the corners), chunky squares so it's crisp from **48→512 px**.

### Verify
- `node -c` clean; `test/emblems.test.js` **45** — golden-pins each emblem's cell grid
  (per-row lit counts + ink set), asserts the full gold ramp (lit bevel, not flat), and
  proves draw() is maskable (corners = field, centre = subject) at 48/192/512 px + graceful
  on bad input. Full Node suite green. **B-owned** (`emblems.js` + test + 6 goldens).
- **[A] hand-off:** add `<script src="emblems.js">`; render the candidates in the Codex
  "Emblems" section (T179) + the `?dev` reveal-all (T180); register `test/emblems.test.js`
  in `pages.yml` (CI gate). Owner picks the launcher icon; the rest become unlockables.

## T172 — gold-hoard ENGINE: beveled-coin splat + hoard scene mode + converge earn-burst ([B])

Built the owner-blessed T174 technique into `fxgl.js`. IMPRESSION, not physics: imply the
bulk with a shaded mound SILHOUETTE + render only the SURFACE coins. All **opt-in**
(existing scenes byte-identical — the scene goldens are unchanged).

### The four capabilities (all pure-math headless-tested)
- **(a) beveled coin** — `drawCoin()`: a lit disc (rim/shadow ring + mid body + inner
  highlight + specular glint) on a real 2D ctx; an axis-aligned squashed-rect fallback on
  a path-less ctx (so the test raster measures it). `look:1` on the particle opts in.
- **(b) per-coin rotation + aspect (squash)** → coins lie at varied angles (asserted: 40
  coins span >20 distinct rots + squashes).
- **(c) hoard scene mode** — `scene.hoard = level|{level,seed,palette}` → `deriveScene`
  seeds the crest-weighted surface coins (`seedHoard`) on a `moundProfile` heightfield;
  the CPU `_still` renders a **dithered gold mound silhouette** (fake-AO, darker at the
  base) + the coins on top. Count rides a **saturating** `hoardLevel = gold/(gold+K)`
  (early gold shows, big totals plateau), quantised to 8 **tiers** (re-seed only on a tier
  change). Capped at `HOARD_CAP 340 ≪ PARTICLE_CAP 512`; reduced-motion → a smaller static
  pile. `deriveHomeScene` passes `state.hoard` through for [A]'s T173.
- **(d) converge earn-burst** — `controller.earnBurst({x,y,tx,ty})` + `convergePos()`: coins
  fly from the earn-point, ease+lob toward the hoard target, and **land (absorbed)** —
  directed, not dispersed. Rides the existing burst machinery/auto-stop.

### Renders on the 2D/CPU path — by design (the T133/T138 lesson)
The hoard renders via the **2D/CPU path**, NOT a 2nd WebGL context. The home backdrop
already holds the 1st WebGL context, and mobile GPUs **refuse a 2nd** (exactly why T133/
T138 moved the celebration to a 2D overlay — "a 2D context always presents"). So the
reliable, presents-everywhere home for the hoard is a 2D overlay, which is what this
implements + tests. **[A] T173 hand-off:** mount a 2D hoard overlay (a `backend:"2d"`
`FXGL.Controller`, like `#fxBurst`) **behind the UI** (z between the backdrop and the
tree/buttons), feed it `setScene({…, hoard: FXGL.hoardLevel(gold)})` (re-render on gold
change), and fire `earnBurst({x,y from the earn-point, tx,ty over the hoard})` on
`addGold`. Keep it low + behind the UI (home a11y contrast bar); reduced-motion → static.

### Verify
- `node -c` clean; `golden-fx` **55** (was 35; +20 for the hoard math + the rendered-pile
  raster + the converge check), `fxgl.test` + full Node suite + all 3 browser gates green;
  existing scene goldens unchanged (opt-in proven). New golden `fx_hoard_scatter`. B-owned
  (`fxgl.js` + tests). Babysitter browser-verifies the 2D-overlay render once [A] wires it;
  owner tunes the feel (mound shape/height, coin size, glint, the K curve).

## T175 — the FOGHORN is back: a sustained TONAL pad ramps the reverb to a rail ([B], 🔴 DO-FIRST)

Owner (totally reproducible): **every** song starts nice then **ramps up to foghorn/pain**
over ~15–30 s. Measured the REAL path (OfflineAudioContext, sustained pad chord → the
engine's own reverb, 16 s): a **sustained `padglass`** (the T155 triangle bed) drives the
reverb to **520 / 143 / 112…** — it RAMPS over the reverb's fill, exactly the owner's tell.

### Root cause: the FDN was NOISE-safe but TONAL-MARGINAL
T151 capped decay at 0.78 measured against **white noise** (broadband → bounded). But a
**sustained tonal** pad concentrates energy on an FDN **comb resonance** where the
effective loop gain ≈ 1, so it builds unboundedly over the multi-second tail → rails the
−1.5 dB limiter into the sustained drone. It's **chaotic/marginal** (the same config gave
0.55 one run, 520 the next — the signature of loop gain ≈ 1). The new T155 sustained pads
are the trigger; the 5 s white-noise gate couldn't see it. Decay sweep (worst over sends,
sustained `padglass`): **0.78 → 143**, but **≤ 0.70 → ~0.5**.

### Fix — two lines of defence
1. **Lower the FDN decay to 0.66** (`FDN_DECAY_DEFAULT`/`_MAX`) — subcritical for sustained
   tonal input with margin (measured: all 5 pads bounded ~0.25–1.3 over 16 s; was 143).
2. **Safety compressor on the reverb RETURN** (`buildGraph`: `reverb.output → reverbComp →
   master`, threshold −3 dB / ratio 12). Transparent at the normal wet (~0.5), but caps any
   residual buildup so a runaway **DECAYS to a ceiling, never rails** — defence in depth so
   the foghorn can't come back via some untested tonal mode.

### Gate extended (it would now CATCH this)
`test/browser/audio.test.js`: a **16 s sustained-pad-chord** render per pad asserts the
late window stays bounded ≤ 2 (the 5 s white-noise test missed this class). Teeth: the
pre-fix 0.78 decay foghorns on the triangle pad (worst-over-sends 65–76 ≫ 2; single-send
is unreliable — the divergence is chaotic). `synth.test` asserts the reverb-return safety
compressor is wired + the decay ceiling is the tonal-safe 0.70.

### Verify
- `node -c` clean; `synth.test` **176**; real-audio gate **27**; `golden-synth`/`synth-wiring`
  + full Node suite + all 3 browser gates green. **B-owned (`synth.js` + tests).** *(Also
  re-blessed `visual_audio.json` for an unrelated upstream [A] audio-menu layout shift —
  all elements present, benign; the visual gate caught it as designed.)* Babysitter
  re-measures a long real-music render; owner confirms on device.

## T174 — research/art pass: representing an accumulating COIN HOARD ([B], research-first; precedes T172)

Owner wants a Smaug/Scrooge gold hoard on the home backdrop — individual beveled coins,
fed by coins flying in from the earn-point, but **"impression, not physics."** Doc:
**`docs/research-coin-hoard.md`** (B-owned; no engine change yet).

Findings: every stylised "big pile of small things" (DuckTales money bin, Spyro gem
hoards, Clash gold storage, leaf/snow/gravel drifts) uses ONE move — **imply the bulk
with a shaped, lit silhouette + dither shading, and render individual items only on the
SURFACE you'd see, scattered with per-item variation; never simulate the interior.** That
also matches brickmap's house style, so three of its recipes port 1:1: **`hash01` seeded
surface-scatter** (foliage `scatter()` — jitter/size/angle/thinning by salts, density on a
slow hash), **disc-mask splat + centre-bright shading** (`splat.wgsl` → the beveled coin),
and **Bayer dither over a gold luminance ramp** (already in `fxgl.js` → shade the mound
body as scenery, 0 particles).

**Recommended technique (for T172, owner to bless):** a three-layer composite inside the
home backdrop — (A) a **dithered mound silhouette** drawn as scenery (heightfield profile
× `level`, gold ramp + fake-AO dither — carries the "amassed" read at 0 particle cost);
(B) **`hash01`-scattered beveled coins** on a thin crest-weighted band (disc + rim + inner
gradient + specular glint, 3 gold tones, per-coin rotation + squash), count on a
**saturating curve** `level = 1 − 1/(1+gold/K)` quantised to ~6–8 tiers (re-seed only on a
tier change); (C) an **attractor earn-burst** (emit → converge on the hoard → settle).
Caps: surface coins ~120/220/340 (low/med/high), all ≪ the 512 `PARTICLE_CAP`; growth is
coverage/height-driven so it plateaus gracefully; DPR-aware; reduced-motion → a static
pile. Wins/limits + the owner-eye open choices (mound shape/height, curve feel, earn
source, legibility-behind-UI) documented honestly. Babysitter surfaces §3+§4 to the owner
before T172 builds.

## T165 — a context SWITCH fully stops the previous generator (no tail / no foghorn) ([B], 🔴 pairs with T164)

Owner (recurring): the switcher "doesn't fully switch — elements of the previous music
continue," and the foghorn returns on switches. Two `synth.js` fixes:

### (1) A real FDN reverb FLUSH on switch (was: only a gain dip)
`releaseMusic` (T134) dipped `reverb.output.gain` to ~0 for 0.13 s — but with decay
0.78 the FDN **delay lines still held ~37% of the tail** when the output recovered →
the old track bled through and the runaway-ish tail fed the sustained low drone (the
foghorn). Added `reverb.flush(t, dur)`: it drives the **feedback gains to 0** for the
window so the delay lines **DRAIN in one pass**, then restores the *live* decay on the
(now empty) lines. `releaseMusic` calls it alongside the output dip. **Real-audio
proof** (OfflineAudioContext, impulse in): post-flush tail energy **0** vs un-flushed
0.0238 — the tail is gone, no carry-over past a swap.

### (2) Idempotent `setContext`
`setContext(current)` while playing is now a **no-op** (tracked via `M.contextName`,
exposed on `musicState().context`). A redundant same-context call used to re-release +
re-seed the SAME track and re-fire the swap transient/tail — which read as "not fully
switching." Defence-in-depth with T164 ([A] stops the needless calls). A *real* switch
still releases the old voices, flushes, and re-aligns to a downbeat (T132/T134 intact).

### Verify
- `node -c` clean; `synth.test` **174** (idempotent no-op fires no flush; a real switch
  drives feedback→0 + releases voices; `flush()` restores the live decay, not a
  constant); `golden-synth` + `synth-wiring` green; real-audio gate **20** (flush drains
  the tail). **B-owned (`synth.js` + tests) only.** Babysitter measures the switch
  transient via OfflineAudioContext; owner's ear is the final word.

## T163 — firm up the brittle `visual_arena` golden ([B], follow-up to T154)

T154's `visual_arena` golden captured a per-cell hue grid, but the Arena's content is
**dynamic** (3v3 enemy team + death-VFX + gold vary per run / environment), so a single
cell would flip → spurious mismatch (it violated T154's own "robust signature, not a
brittle pixel diff" rule). Fix: a `dynamic` flag on the screen config — dynamic screens
(Arena) now sign as **`{active, element-PRESENCE booleans}`** only (no volatile colour
grid / bbox). Structurally stable across runs+environments, still catches "arena broke /
key control gone". Re-blessed `visual_arena`. Colour precision stays where there's a
fixed baseline (home flagship + home/audio grids — both byte-identical, untouched).
Verified: `node -c` clean, deterministic over 3 runs, full suite + all 3 browser gates
green. B-owned (`test/browser/visual.test.js`, `test/golden/visual_arena.json`).

---

## T154 — key-screen VISUAL-REGRESSION gate (extends the T150 harness) ([B], proactive)

The session's recurring pain: visual regressions only the owner catches (the blue
home backdrop, the celebration `0×0`, layout clips) — the Node suite is blind to
pixels. Generalised T150's render harness into a per-key-screen gate:
`test/browser/visual.test.js` loads the REAL app @ 390×844 / dpr 2.75 and captures a
ROBUST (not brittle-pixel-diff) signature per screen, committed as goldens
(`UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` re-blesses intentional changes).

### What it captures (robust by construction)
- **Hue-CLASS grid** per screen (4×8 regions): the full-page screenshot is round-
  tripped through the browser's own decoder (→ `drawImage` downscale → `getImageData`,
  no hand-rolled PNG parser, no WebGL read-back caveat) and each cell is classified
  to a colour FAMILY (`purple`/`blue`/`warm`/…) — a category, so render noise can't
  flake it, but a purple→blue drift flips cells.
- **Element presence + 5%-bucketed bbox** of each screen's critical controls (home:
  `startBtn`/`modeTree`/`navRow`/`goldBar`; audio: `musicSwitch` + the 3 ranges;
  arena: `arenaMeta`/`arenaBody`/`arenaFight`). A missing/moved control is caught.
- **FLAGSHIP — the home backdrop hue.** Screenshots `#fxBackdrop`, averages it, and
  asserts it classifies **`purple`** (T153's fixed brand colour: avg rgb ≈ 69,49,98 →
  B-high, R>G). The exact regression that shipped (purple→blue) FAILS here.
- Screens covered: **home, Audio menu, Arena** (arena via a `halves.unlocked={legacy:1}`
  init-script). *(Results has no hash route — it's post-game — so it's out of this
  static gate; a follow-up could drive a game to it.)*

### Determinism + teeth
- `reducedMotion:'reduce'` → FXGL renders a STILL frame; coarse hue-classes + bucketed
  bboxes → **byte-stable** (verified over repeated runs). Each screen is loaded FRESH
  (the T157 back-gesture history sentinels hijack in-page hash-hopping: audio→arena
  landed on settings — a fresh load per screen avoids it).
- **Teeth proven in-gate:** a blue backdrop (rgb 63,151,216) classifies `blue` ≠
  `purple` (flagship would fail); and the signature compare CATCHES a single region
  hue flip (purple→blue) and a missing critical element (layout regression).
- Opt-in/guarded (skips clean with no browser → Node-only CI unaffected); screenshots
  saved to `test/browser/screenshots/`.

### Verify
- `node -c` clean; 13 checks green, deterministic across runs; full Node suite + all
  three browser gates (render/audio/visual) green. **B-owned** (`test/browser/*` +
  `test/golden/visual_*`). *(If a headless browser ever joins CI, [A] can register
  `test/browser/*.test.js` in `pages.yml` — until then it runs locally/on-demand.)*

## T155 — distinct PAD/bed timbre per style (kill the shared "synth string") ([B], OWNER-PRIORITY)

Owner (2026-06-22): **"every style seems to share the same synth string sound… makes
them feel a little samey."** Root cause: all 12 contexts set `pad: "pad"` — the
identical detuned-**sawtooth** unison bed. The leads/bass already varied; the **pad —
the most continuously-audible voice — was the same saw everywhere.**

### 4 new PAD-class beds (`PATCHES`) — genuinely different SPECTRA, not cutoff tweaks
Built on the existing engines (no new engine needed):
| pad | engine/wave + filter | character |
|---|---|---|
| `pad` (kept) | unison **saw** + lowpass 1100 | warm analog bed |
| `padglass` | unison **triangle** + soft lowpass 2000, very slow swell | airy/glassy choir |
| `padep` | **fm** (ratio 1, index 110) + mellow lowpass, sustained | electric-piano / Rhodes |
| `padpwm` | unison **square** + brighter lowpass 2800, snappy | retro/chip hollow bed |
| `padorgan` | unison **square** through a **bandpass** (cut 760, Q7), stabby | hollow organ stab |

**Per-style mapping** (5 distinct beds across the 12): saw → arena/synthwave/bigroom ·
glass → menu/ambient/tropical · ep → lofi/dnb · pwm → chiptune/boss8bit · organ →
dubstep/techno.

### Proven SPECTRALLY distinct (the output-feature rule — golden pins names, not timbre)
Measured each pad's **spectral centroid** via real `OfflineAudioContext` + an FFT (new
section in `test/browser/audio.test.js`): `padep 189 · padglass 457 · padorgan 1054 ·
pad 1436 · padpwm 1897` Hz — a **1708 Hz** spread, min adjacent gap **268 Hz** (≥150
floor) → audibly different beds, not one reskinned oscillator. (`padorgan` was tuned —
bandpass Q 3→7, env→0.15 — to separate it from `pad`; was 71 Hz apart, now 382.)

### Verify
- `node -c` clean. **`golden-synth` UNCHANGED** (its scores pin role+midi *events*, not
  patch names — so the timbre swap correctly causes **no** score churn; the DoD's
  "re-bless" wasn't needed). `synth.test` now asserts ≥5 distinct pad beds, all with
  distinct signatures, spanning ≥3 waveforms + ≥2 filter types, and that the 12 styles
  use ≥4 distinct beds. Full Node suite + both browser gates green.
- 🔊 **Babysitter:** independently measure the per-style pad spectra (centroids above).
  Final "less samey?" is the owner's ear. **B-owned only** (`synth.js` + its tests).

## T152 — celebration particles: small/fine size + spread + off-centre emission ([B] engine side)

Owner: **"very small particle sizes, emanating from the point of interest (e.g. where
the inventory toast appears), colour-coded."** Colour + arbitrary `{x,y}` + `palette`
were already accepted by `seedBurst`/`seedCelebrate`; this adds the **size** + **spread**
levers and proves off-centre small bursts stay visible. (The `main.js` call-site wiring
— emit from each source element's rect, pass the small size — is the **[A]** half.)

### Engine additions (`fxgl.js`) — opt-in, defaults byte-identical
- **`sizePx`** (explicit MAX particle size, screen px) and **`sizeScale`** (multiplier)
  → small/fine particles. Floored at **`MIN_PARTICLE_PX = 2`** screen px so "small"
  stays crisp on-device (DPR-aware via the T138 `pxScale` / GL `uRes` path) and never
  goes sub-pixel/invisible. `sizeRange(opts, defMin, defMax)` resolves the range.
- **`spread`** (1 = default, `<1` hugs the source point — "emanate from the thing",
  `>1` wider) scales the outward spray (`spreadMul`, clamped 0.05–4).
- Both `seedBurst` + `seedCelebrate` use them; with no opts the lerp args are
  **identical**, so the goldens + determinism hold (verified: `golden-fx` unchanged).
- Exposed `MIN_PARTICLE_PX`, `sizeRange`, `spreadMul` for tests/inspection.

### Visibility gate extended (the T138 rasteriser → off-centre + small)
`test/golden-fx.test.js` now also fires a **small (`sizePx:5`), tight (`spread:0.4`),
OFF-CENTRE (0.8,0.3)** celebrate and rasterises it: asserts real in-bounds coverage
(19 220 lit px), on-screen size **5.1 px** (≥ floor 2, **<** the bold-default ≥8), and
the coverage **centroid sits on the source** (0.80,0.24 ≈ 0.80,0.30 — not screen-centre
0.5,0.55). Plus property checks: `sizePx` caps+floors the size and is clearly finer
than bold; `spread<1` cuts horizontal travel (0.10 ≪ 0.33). New golden
`fx_small_offcentre`.

### Verify
- `node -c fxgl.js` clean; `fxgl.test` + `golden-fx` **35** (was 28) green; full Node
  suite + both browser gates green.

### [A] hand-off (the T152 wiring half)
At each celebration call site in `main.js`, replace `x:0.5,y:0.55` with the **source
element's normalised centre** (`el.getBoundingClientRect()` → `/innerWidth,/innerHeight`)
and pass **`sizePx`** (small, e.g. 4–6) + the existing rarity/rank/topic `palette`
(+ optionally `spread<1` to hug the source): inventory toast → toast rect + rarity
palette; rank → rank-badge rect + rank colour; mastery → topic node/banner + topic
accent; arena win → defeated-enemy portrait rect + gold/hero. Engine is ready.

## T151 — synth output DIVERGES exponentially: non-resonant damping + a measured decay cap ([B], OWNER-PRIORITY BUG)

**Owner-priority, browser-measured.** The Babysitter tapped an `AnalyserNode` on
`Synth.output()` (= `E.master`, pre-limiter) in headless Chromium: the master output
grew **exponentially in every context, even with no switch** (menu peaked
`0.36→1.93→7.42→33.6→159` over 3 s). The brickwall limiter then clamped a 30–160×
signal → escalating distortion = the owner's "audio sounds bad."

### Two independent fixes (the first alone was a PARTIAL fix — see below)
The engine's only feedback path is the **FDN reverb**. **(1)** Its **damping lowpass**
ran at the Web-Audio **default Q=1**, which (Web Audio reads a `"lowpass"` Q in dB,
linear `10^(Q/20)`) is a **+2 dB RESONANT peak (~1.25× linear) AT the cutoff** that
multiplies the feedback loop gain (`decay×1.25 > 1` for any `decay ≳ 0.8`). Set it to
**Q = −3.0103 dB = linear 0.7071, maximally-flat Butterworth** — *measured* real-Web-
Audio peak gain is exactly **1.0** (passive). **(2)** But that alone was a **partial
fix** (Babysitter re-measured: menu/lofi/dubstep bounded ✓, but `ambient` — `reverbDecay
0.9` — still blew up to 1096). Even with a perfectly *passive* filter the real FDN
grows a pole outside the unit circle above ~0.82 (the ideal "`0.5·H` orthonormal ⇒
stable for decay<1" misses real biquad / fractional-delay gain). So the tail decay is
**CLAMPED to 0.78** (`FDN_DECAY_MAX`, the default), comfortably below the cliff.

### How decay 0.9 false-greened my first gate — and the fix
My first gate was an **analytic** sample-level FDN sim; it *declared* 0.9 stable, but
the **real Web Audio diverged** — the idealised model missed the excess gain. Replaced
it with TWO honest gates, measured against an OfflineAudioContext ground truth
(real `BiquadFilter`s, 5 s continuous excitation @ the 0.22 send level):
`peak 0.45 @ decay 0.78 · 0.45↔2.4 @ 0.80 (ON the cliff) · 2.4 @ 0.82 · 9.9 @ 0.83`.
- **`test/synth.test.js`** (Node, in CI) — a **constant invariant**: `dampQ ≤ 0`,
  `decayMax ≤ 0.78`, and **every** style's effective decay ≤ 0.78. Can't false-green
  (it checks the shipped constants vs the measured-safe envelope, no simulation).
- **`test/browser/audio.test.js`** (real audio, opt-in) — renders **all 12 styles'
  ACTUAL reverb** (`Synth.makeReverb`) through an `OfflineAudioContext` for 5 s and
  asserts **peak ≤ 2** (measured worst **0.586**). Teeth: the same render at the old
  unclamped `0.9` **diverges** (peak 6.0e6 ≫ 2) — the exact case the analytic model
  false-greened.

`ambient` keeps its washy identity via its high reverb **SEND (0.55)** + slow 60 BPM,
not a longer decay. Exposed `Synth.reverbParams()` (FDN topology + `dampQ` + decays).

### Verify
- `node -c synth.js` clean. `test/synth.test.js` **161**, `golden-synth` 19,
  `synth-wiring` 52, `sound` 50, full Node suite — all green. Real-audio gate: **14**
  checks, all 12 styles bounded ≤ 0.586 in REAL Web Audio.
- 🔊 **Babysitter re-measure:** the `AnalyserNode` peak on `Synth.output()` should now
  stay bounded (≤ ~2) over ≥5 s in **every** context incl. `ambient`, and across switches.

## T150 — autonomous BROWSER-RENDER gate (Playwright) — catch "rendered but invisible" ([B], PROCESS-FIX)

Our whole Node suite is stub-only — it can't see a rendered pixel or `display:none`,
which is exactly how the celebration bug (T149) hid through six rounds. New B-owned,
**opt-in** browser gate (skips cleanly → Node-only CI unaffected):
- **`test/browser/render.test.js`** — loads the REAL app in headless Chromium at a
  **phone viewport + dpr 2.75**, captures JS errors (resource-load noise filtered),
  fires the **real celebration** (the production FX-tester handler), and asserts
  `#fxBurst.clientWidth>0` **AND** measured lit-pixel coverage (~3.8e5 px). **Teeth:**
  re-nests `#fxBurst` in a `display:none` wrapper → asserts `clientWidth===0` (the
  exact T149 signature) → the gate would have caught T149 instantly. Saves screenshots.
- **`test/browser/_harness.js`** — shared Playwright resolve + read-only static server.
- Run: `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers node test/browser/render.test.js`.

**[A] hand-off:** these browser gates are opt-in (skip without a browser). If we ever
add a headless browser to CI, register `test/browser/*.test.js` in `pages.yml` (an [A]
task) for a real regression guard; until then they run on demand / locally.

---

## T138 — celebration STILL invisible: the REAL cause (DPR downscale) + a visibility gate ([B])

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** B-owned files only (`fxgl.js`,
`test/golden-fx.test.js` + goldens); **zero edits to any existing Halves file.**

### ⟵ CORRECTED diagnosis (owner's tester readout = `1038×2305`, ready)
The canvas is **full-size**, so it was **NOT** the resize/occlusion cause my first pass
guessed. The real bug: the buffer is `dpr·res`× the CSS size (≈**2.75×** on the Poco
X3) and the browser **downscales it back** — so particles drawn at **6–18 buffer px
showed at only ~2–6 SCREEN px**, fading out = *drawn (the count-golden passed) but
invisible*. **Primary fix:** the CPU 2D path now **scales the draw size by the
buffer/CSS factor** (`pxScale = dpr·res`, set on resize) so a particle shows at a
**constant ~6–18 SCREEN px** regardless of DPR (floor 2). Celebration sizes bumped to
**6–18** for boldness. (The re-fit + `canPresent()` from the first pass are kept as
defensive — harmless, and cover the other candidates if they ever bite.)

### Engine changes
- **`pxScale` size-up** (the real fix) — particles draw at a visible *screen* size after
  the DPR downscale, not `size/dpr` (≈1.5–3px = the invisibility).
- `_ignite()` **re-fits the canvas** before drawing (fire-before-layout 1×1 defence).
- **`controller.canPresent()`** surfaces a null 2D context (canvas bound to a stale GL
  context → an [A] re-mount), and particles **floor to ≥2 px**.

### The REAL visibility gate (rasterised — the structural guard)
The T133 golden only **counted `fillRect` calls** (a transparent/off-canvas/tiny draw
passes it — how this hid). Added a **rasteriser** that paints each rect (with alpha)
into an in-bounds pixel buffer and measures **(a) lit coverage** AND **(b) on-screen
particle size**. At the owner's `1038×2305` device the celebrate frame now paints
**~572k lit px (24% coverage)** at **~17.8 SCREEN px** particles; the gate **fails** on
a zero-coverage / 1×1 frame (demonstrated) *and* would fail if particles shrank back
below ~8 screen px (the actual bug). `fx_celebrate_visibility` golden committed.

### Root-causes addressed (engine side)
1. **Fire-before-layout 1×1 buffer** (the likeliest): a celebration is often fired
   right after mount / before layout settles, leaving the canvas at **1×1** (→ nothing
   visible). **Fix:** `_ignite()` now **re-fits the canvas (`_applyResize()`) before
   drawing**, so a burst/celebration always sizes itself to the live viewport
   regardless of when the [A] caller's `resize()` ran. (Verified: a 360×640@dpr2
   canvas with no explicit resize now draws at 720×1280.)
2. **Null 2D context** (the other candidate — canvas already bound to a WebGL/WebGPU
   context, so `getContext("2d")` returns null and the backend silently no-ops): added
   **`controller.canPresent()`** so the tester can *surface* it (true = real context;
   false = re-mount on a fresh canvas — an [A] fix). 
3. **Sub-pixel safety:** particles now floor to **≥1 device px**.

### The REAL visibility gate (the structural guard the owner needs)
The T133 golden only **counted `fillRect` calls** — a transparent / off-canvas / 1×1
draw passes it, which is *exactly* how this stayed green while invisible. Added a
**rasterised** check: a test context that actually **paints each rect (with its alpha)
into an in-bounds pixel buffer** and measures lit coverage. The celebrate frame paints
**~56 000 lit px (6.1% of a 720×1280 canvas)**; the check **fails on a zero-coverage /
1×1 / off-canvas frame** (demonstrated: a 1×1 buffer → ≤1 lit px → the check trips).
Committed as `fx_celebrate_visibility`.

### Verify
`node -c` clean; `golden-fx.test.js` (+ the rasterised visibility checks +
re-fit/`canPresent` engine tests); full suite green. **On-device confirmation is the
owner's check** (green gates necessary-not-sufficient — this hid behind them before);
the re-fit fixes the most likely cause and the gate now catches a recurrence.

### Hand-off to Builder A
- The overlay now self-sizes on `celebrate()`, so the shower should present. If the
  owner's tester shows **`canPresent() === false`** (or `dimensions()` 0×0), the
  `#fxBurst` canvas is bound to a stale GL context → **re-mount it on a fresh
  `<canvas>` element** (that's the [A]-side residual).

---

## T139 (part 2) — the 12-style palette (owner-approved) · DONE

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** B-owned files only (`synth.js`,
`test/synth.test.js`, `test/golden-synth.test.js`, `test/golden/synth_score_*.json`);
**zero edits to any existing Halves file.** Owner OK'd the T141 palette ("move ahead…
add them to the song picker"); built the 12 from `research-music-styles.md` §2.

### The 12 styles (`CONTEXTS`) — `id` · **label** (for A's T140 launcher + routing)
1. `menu` · **Neon Lobby** *(kept)* — bright Ionian lobby
2. `arena` · **Phrygian Onslaught** *(kept)* — dark driving wub
3. `lofi` · **Lo-Fi Study** — swung 76 Dorian, soft *(calm; route the solve screen here)*
4. `ambient` · **Ambient Drift** — 60 Lydian, **drumless**, very wet long tail *(calm)*
5. `chiptune` · **Chiptune Rush** — 150 pentatonic square arps, dry *(uses `chip`)*
6. `synthwave` · **Synthwave Cruise** — 112 Aeolian, gated-snare arp
7. `dubstep` · **Dubstep Victory** — 140 half-time wobble + **the DROP win-sting** (`victory:true`)
8. `dnb` · **Liquid DnB** — 174 breakbeat + wobble sub
9. `bigroom` · **Festival** — 128 four-floor Lydian *(festive; route events here)*
10. `boss8bit` · **8-Bit Boss March** — 140 Phrygian square march *(uses `chip`)*
11. `tropical` · **Tropical Pluck** — 104 swung Mixolydian, airy
12. `techno` · **Hypno Techno** — 126 four-floor minimal wob

`Synth.STYLE_IDS` = the 12; **`Synth.styles()`** → `[{id,label}…]` for the launcher.
The win sting: **`Synth.sting("victory")`** fires the Dubstep Victory drop (T139 pt1).

### [A] hand-off (T140)
- List `Synth.styles()` (12 labels) in the switcher; `setContext(id, {now:true})` to
  audition. Route screens to styles: **solve→`lofi`**, menu→`menu`, arena→`arena`
  (+`intensity()`), events→`bigroom`. Fire **`Synth.sting("victory")`** on a win.
- **Back-compat:** `CONTEXTS.solve`/`.event` are kept as **aliases** (→`lofi`/`bigroom`)
  so pre-T140 routing keeps playing; **drop them in T140** once screens use the named ids.

### Verify
`node -c` clean; `synth.test.js` **144** (12-style spread, ambient drumless, dubstep
wobble+victory, `styles()` labels); **`golden-synth`** now pins **all 12** score goldens +
the **all-12 mutual-distinctness** gate (regenerated — intentional; old solve/event
score goldens removed). All gates green.

---

## T139 (part 1) — the no-regret engine ADDITIONS the 12-style palette needs ([B])

**Status: additions DONE — CONTEXTS HELD for the owner's palette OK.** B-owned files
only (`synth.js`, `test/synth.test.js`); **zero edits to any existing Halves file.**
Per the pointer: don't finalise the 12 style rows until the owner thumbs-ups the
T141 palette (a style may be swapped) — but build the additions that are wasted by no
outcome. Done; the `CONTEXTS` swap + golden-distinctness-to-12 lands once the owner OKs.

### Additions shipped (all tiny, opt-in, tested)
1. **Tempo-synced wub wobble** — a context `wobble` (cycles-per-beat) locks the wub
   LFO to the beat (`rate = tempo/60 × wobble`); `renderVoice` takes an optional
   `lfoRate`, the scheduler computes it for `sub`-engine voices. (dubstep/dnb/techno)
2. **`chip` patch** — a fast, snappy square pluck (`{a:.001,d:.06,s:0,r:.02}`,
   bright filter) for chiptune/8-bit arps.
3. **Swing** — a context `swing` field delays the off-16ths by a fraction (the grid
   stays even, only the scheduled time shifts → a real groove). (lofi/tropical)
4. **Per-context reverb decay** — `makeReverb` exposes `setDecay` (rescales the FDN
   feedback, stays < 1 = stable); `Synth.setReverbDecay` + `setContext` apply a
   style's `reverbDecay` (a long tail for ambient, short for dry styles).
5. **The victory DROP** — `sting("victory")`/`"drop"` is now a real audible dubstep
   drop: a filtered-**noise riser** builds, then a heavy **sub-wub** (tempo-synced
   wobble) + a **kick** + a bright **stab** + a sparkle land together — on the
   **un-ducked SFX bus** so it cuts THROUGH (the T128 lesson), ducking the music bed.
   (Replaces the old subtle wub+bell the owner said "doesn't seem to exist".)

### Verify
`node -c` clean; `synth.test.js` **142** (+12): wobble locks to tempo×cycles, the
chip square pluck, swing shifts off-beat timings, `setReverbDecay` rescales the tail,
the victory drop is a one-shot full gesture (riser+sub-wub+kick+stab) that ducks the
bed. All gates green; `golden-synth` unchanged (CONTEXTS untouched this push).

### Next (on owner OK → T139 part 2)
- Replace `CONTEXTS` with the agreed 12 (keep menu/arena; drop solve/event; the 10
  new from `research-music-styles.md` §2, using `wobble`/`swing`/`reverbDecay`/`chip`),
  extend `golden-synth` distinctness to all 12 (regen intentional), hand A the final
  names/labels for T140.

## T141 — research: musical styles → a concrete 12-style palette ([B], doc; precedes T139)

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** New B-owned file only
(`docs/research-music-styles.md`); **zero edits to any existing Halves file.** Owner:
keep **menu**+**arena**, the others feel samey, bring back the **dubstep victory** —
*"a research pass to really get those 10 new styles unique/interesting,"* then a
12-style launcher palette. Same T119→T120 pattern (research → engine).

### What shipped
- **`docs/research-music-styles.md`** — the genre DNA (tempo · mode/progression ·
  rhythmic feel · instrumentation/register · the production trick that makes it
  recognisable) of a spread of styles, each **mapped to this engine's levers**
  (modes, Euclid kit, patches pad/pluck/bass/bell/lead/wub, ADSR, FDN reverb,
  density, root, leadOct), ending in a **concrete 12-row `CONTEXTS` table** T139 can
  implement directly.
- **The 12** (menu+arena kept; 10 new): Lo-Fi Study *(calm/solve)*, Ambient Drift
  *(calm)*, Chiptune Rush *(festive)*, Synthwave Cruise, **Dubstep Victory** *(the
  drop / win sting)*, Liquid DnB, Festival *(festive)*, 8-Bit Boss March, Tropical
  Pluck, Hypno Techno. Spread: tempo **60→174**, 8 modes, feels span
  drone/swung/half-time/backbeat/four-floor/breakbeat/march, reverb 0.04→0.55.
- **Flagged the small engine additions** T139 needs (all tiny, no-build): a
  **tempo-synced wub wobble** (dubstep/dnb), a `chip` square-pluck patch (chiptune/
  8-bit), an optional scheduler **swing** (lofi/tropical), an optional per-context
  reverb decay (ambient), and the **dubstep victory drop** (a `sting()` build→drop on
  the **un-ducked SFX bus** — the T128 lesson). Every style renders on *today's*
  patches; the adds just sharpen 3–4.
- 4 cited references (dubstep/chiptune/synthwave DNA, web-researched) + the prior
  `research-generative-audio.md`.

### Next
- **Babysitter surfaces the 12-row palette to the owner for a thumbs-up** (owner may
  swap a style). Then **T139** [B]: implement the 12 in `CONTEXTS` (replace solve/
  event), build the dubstep victory drop + the flagged patch adds, extend the
  `golden-synth` distinctness gate to all 12, and hand A the final names/labels for
  the T140 launcher/wiring.

## T134 — clean immediate context-swap (no overlap) + audible distinctness ([B])

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** B-owned files only (`synth.js`,
`test/synth.test.js`, `test/golden/synth_score_*.json`); **zero edits to any existing
Halves file.** Off stand-by: owner live on the T129 switcher — *"sounds like the
songs play over each other rather than switching, or they sound really similar."*
Both real, both engine-side (the live wiring drives `Sy.setContext` + `Sy.swapNow`
on my `CONTEXTS`, so these land).

### (a) Clean swap — no layered overlap
The T132 instant `swapNow()` reset the generator but left the old voices + the
multi-second FDN-reverb tail ringing **over** the new context (and rapid taps piled
tails up). Fix (immediate path only — the default phrase swap keeps its musical ring):
- **Track the live music voices** (`renderVoice` now hands its amp param back; the
  scheduler registers each on `M.active`, pruned as they end).
- **`releaseMusic()`** on `swapNow()`: fast ~75ms release of every active voice
  (`cancelAndHoldAtTime`→`setTargetAtTime`, no click), a brief music-bus fade-out→in,
  and a dip of the **reverb output** to kill the carry-over tail — so a switch **cuts
  in cleanly**.

### (b) Audible distinctness
`solve/menu/event` were too alike (shared pad+bass+pluck/bell, close tempo, differing
only by mode). Reworked all four `CONTEXTS` to spread across **every** audible lever
(register/instrumentation/tempo/density/kit), keeping calm-solve ↔ energetic-arena:
- **solve** — 72 BPM, low (root 50) Dorian, **DRUMLESS**, sparse, wet, soft pad+pluck (intimate).
- **menu** — 96 BPM, Ionian, a **high bell** lead, light kit (welcoming).
- **event** — 112 BPM, **high** Lydian, dense, busy hats, bright pluck (festive/sparkly).
- **arena** — 124 BPM, low **Phrygian** (darker), full driving kit + the **wub** bass, dry (energetic).
- Added `snareK` to `normalizeMusic` (so solve can be fully drumless).

### Verification
`node -c` clean; `synth.test.js` **130** (+10): the immediate swap releases voices
(`activeVoices→0`) + taps the reverb/bus fades; the **default swap does NOT** release
early (ring intact); the four contexts differ on 4 distinct tempos / roots / modes,
solve drumless, varied lead instrumentation. `golden-synth` scores **regenerated**
(intentional content change) and **still mutually distinct**. All gates green.
*(Headless proves the mechanism + distinctness; the owner's ear is the final check —
flagged.)*

### Hand-off to Builder A
- No API change needed — the existing `setContext(name)` + `swapNow()` path now cuts
  cleanly and the contexts are clearly distinct. (For a deliberate switch keep using
  `swapNow()`/`{now:true}`; screen-driven music may use the default phrase swap.)

## T133 — make the overlay CELEBRATION actually render on-device ([B], engine gap)

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** B-owned files only (`fxgl.js`,
`test/fxgl.test.js`, `test/golden-fx.test.js` + a new golden); **zero edits to any
existing Halves file.** Off stand-by: A's T125 `fxBigBurst`→resize→`celebrate()`
wiring is correct + tested but shows **nothing live** — `#fxBurst` is a **2nd
WebGL/WebGPU context**, which mobile GPUs (the Poco-X3 target) commonly refuse/lose,
so the z-58 overlay never presents.

### The fix (route b: a Canvas2D overlay — always presents)
The diagnosis is a GPU-context-count limit, not a logic bug. A **Canvas2D** context
has **no** such limit, so it reliably inits + presents. The engine's `CPUBackend`
already draws particles via `fillRect`; I added a way to **force** it:
- **`FXGL.mount(canvas, { backend: "2d" })`** (or `{ canvas2d: true }`) → `_init`
  selects the **Canvas2D backend up front**, bypassing WebGL/WebGPU entirely (no 2nd
  GL context is ever requested). It still **animates** `burst()`/`celebrate()` (the
  loop drives `renderFrame` → `fillRect` per particle, the same closed-form
  trajectory as the GL path), auto-stops, frees its buffer, honours
  reduced-motion/`setQuality`.
- Hardened the GPU fallback too: `_initSync` now routes its no-GL fallback through
  the shared `_initCanvas2D()`.
- Added `controller.dimensions()` + `isReady()` so the overlay's **ready + non-1×1
  size** can be asserted before it draws (the invisible trap).

### Verify (break the "green-but-invisible" trap)
- Headless: the forced-2D overlay reaches **ready + sized 360×640**, and a
  celebration **actually draws** — **9632 `fillRect`s across the shower**, 600 in a
  single mid-shower frame (a regression to "renders nothing" makes these 0 → fail).
- **A new golden `fx_celebrate_2d_frame`** snapshots the real Canvas2D-overlay frame
  (the drawn-rect distribution in an 8×6 grid + count) — so a future "renders
  nothing" collapses it to empty and **fails CI**.
- Tests: `fxgl.test.js` **124** checks; `golden-fx.test.js` **19**. `node -c` clean;
  all gates green. *(Headless proves it draws; final on-device confirmation is the
  owner's live check after A re-points `#fxBurst` — flagged below.)*

### Hand-off to Builder A
- Mount the **`#fxBurst` overlay with `{ backend: "2d" }`** (a Canvas2D context at
  z-58, in front of the panels) instead of the failing 2nd GL context; keep the
  backdrop (`#fxBackdrop`) on WebGL/WebGPU as-is. `celebrate()` then presents the
  shower over the UI. (The backdrop stays the single GL context; the overlay is 2D —
  no context-count conflict.) Register the two golden gates in `pages.yml` (still the
  [A] step, as for the other gates).

### Next (Builder B)
- Back to reactive stand-by unless another engine gap surfaces.

---

## T132 — `synth.js` immediate context-swap lever ([B], engine gap from T129)

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** B-owned files only (`synth.js`,
`test/synth.test.js`); **zero edits to any existing Halves file.** Off stand-by:
A's T129 music-switcher surfaced a real engine gap — the scheduler adopted
`M.spec = M.want` **only at a phrase boundary**, so a deliberate `setContext` lagged
up to ~one phrase (~8–11 s), which the owner read as "music never changes."

### What shipped
- **`Synth.setContext(name, { now: true })`** and **`Synth.swapNow()`** — when
  `now`, **adopt the pending spec immediately**: force `M.spec = M.want`, re-align the
  phrase counter (`M.step`/`M.phrase` → 0, a clean **downbeat** entry), reset the
  melodic state, and reseed. So the new context's harmony/patches/reverb take effect
  on the **next scheduled step (≤1 step)**, not the next phrase.
- **No click/dropout**: respects the existing lookahead — already-scheduled notes
  finish; only the *generator* switches now. **Default (no `now`) is unchanged** (the
  musical phrase-boundary swap).
- Added a tiny `Synth.musicState()` introspection (spec/want/step/phrase/playing) for
  tests + the [A] wire.
- Tests +9 (now **120**): default `setContext` mid-phrase does NOT swap (lag
  preserved) and adopts at the next phrase boundary (unchanged); `{now:true}` flips
  the generator **immediately** (new mode/tempo, `step===0`) and the next scheduled
  step plays from it; `swapNow()` adopts a pending want; `{now}` lands exactly the
  target context's spec. The assertions **distinguish ≤1-step from ≤1-phrase**.

### Hand-off to Builder A
- For an instant switch in the T129 Settings music-switcher (and any deliberate
  context change), call `Synth.setContext(name, { now: true })` instead of the bare
  `setContext(name)`. Screen-driven music can keep the default (musical) swap.

### Next (Builder B)
- Back to reactive stand-by unless the owner wants more / another gap surfaces.

---

## T130 — Golden-snapshot harness (brickmap-style render-regression) ([B])

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** New B-owned files only
(`test/golden-util.js`, `test/golden-fx.test.js`, `test/golden-synth.test.js`,
`test/golden/*.json`); **zero edits to any existing Halves file.** The structural
fix for the recurring "green gates, broken feature" gap (T118/T125/T128): source-grep
gates don't see output; **golden snapshots of actual output do.**

### Studied brickmap's golden-render
`docs/milestones/D1-headless-render.md` + `development.md`: brickmap renders a known
scene offscreen, compares to a **committed reference within tolerance**, regenerates
on demand. Its GPU/llvmpipe/PNG capture is **native-only** → out of scope; I ported
the **idea** (deterministic output → compact committed golden → compare-or-regen) to
our headless engine outputs. GPU/WebGL/full-layout goldens need a browser
(Puppeteer) — noted as a future opt-in, kept CI Node-only.

### What shipped
- **`test/golden-util.js`** — `check(name, value)`: default run **compares** the
  value against `test/golden/<name>.json` and **fails with the first differing line**;
  **`UPDATE_GOLDEN=1`** **regenerates** them (the "new things show up" workflow).
  Goldens are compact, committed, diff-reviewable JSON.
- **`test/golden-fx.test.js`** — pins the **FXGL CPU-still** render of representative
  scenes (Arena biome r9-boss, home backdrop, a Frostpeak scenery grid) as a
  downsampled 12×9 rgb signature (quantised /16 = tolerance), plus **`burst()` and
  `celebrate()`** particle distributions (8×6 occupancy grid + live count) at fixed
  seeds/times — the exact closed-form trajectory the GPU/CPU backends use. Includes a
  **self-check that a one-cell render change is CAUGHT**.
- **`test/golden-synth.test.js`** — pins each context's **deterministic scheduled
  score** (first 32 steps' events, mirroring `musicTick`'s phrase-seeding) for
  solve/menu/arena/event, **and asserts they are MUTUALLY DISTINCT** — the explicit
  golden that would have caught **T128 ("every context sounds the same")**.
- Verified the harness **catches a deliberate mutation** (a perturbed golden →
  exit 1 + a precise diff hint) and **passes** after an intentional `UPDATE_GOLDEN`
  regen. `node -c` clean; full existing suite green.

### Hand-off to Builder A (CI gate registration)
- The collision rule keeps `pages.yml` [A]-owned, so (as with `fxgl.test.js`/
  `synth.test.js`) **[A] registers the two gates** in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`:
  `node test/golden-fx.test.js` and `node test/golden-synth.test.js`. They're
  gate-ready (exit non-zero on any unexpected render/score change). Workflow for an
  intended change: `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 node test/golden-*.test.js`, review the JSON diff,
  commit.

### Next (Builder B)
- Back to reactive stand-by unless the owner wants more; the harness can later be
  extended (glyph/icon goldens are a possible [A] adoption).

---

## T126 — FXGL: a BIG "celebration" burst mode (loads of particles) ([B])

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** B-owned files only (`fxgl.js`,
`test/fxgl.test.js`); **zero edits to any existing Halves file** (the [A] wire is
T125). Off stand-by: the owner wants celebrations with "loads of particles" — the
T94 burst (cap 256) reads as too subtle.

### What shipped
- **`FXGL.celebrate(opts)`** (and `controller.celebrate`) — a big firework/shower:
  `seedCelebrate` seeds **far more, bigger, longer-lived** particles with a **tall
  upward launch + gravity fall** and a **bright festive default palette**, capped at
  a new **`CELEBRATE_CAP = 800`** (vs the burst's 256).
- **Reuses the entire T94 burst pipeline** — same particle shape, same **closed-form
  in-shader trajectory** (the burst VS/FS, instanced, one draw/frame — **no
  per-particle JS**, so 800 stays in the Poco-X3 budget), same transient subsystem.
  Refactored `burst()`/`celebrate()` to share `_ignite()`, so the celebration
  **inherits every invariant**: seeded/deterministic, **auto-stops + frees its
  buffer**, single-RAF/no-leak, coalesces with in-flight bursts.
- **Reduced motion → a calmer, smaller, shorter shower**; **`setQuality` degrades the
  count** (cap scales with the quality particle budget); GPU→CPU fallback intact.
- **No regression**: `burst()` still caps at 256; the ambient field is untouched.
- Tests +14 (now **116**): `CELEBRATE_CAP` ceiling, seedCelebrate caps/deterministic/
  bigger-and-longer-than-burst/reduced-smaller/bright-default; `celebrate()` fires
  hundreds, one RAF, one instanced draw/frame, auto-stops + frees buffer, `setQuality`
  degrades the count; `burst()` 256 cap not regressed.

### Hand-off to Builder A (T125 wire)
- Fire `FXGL.celebrate({ x, y, palette?, seed })` on the big win moments (Arena
  victory / a legendary unlock) instead of (or alongside) the smaller `burst()`. It
  auto-stops, so no teardown. `seed` from the event for determinism; `palette` can
  follow rarity (defaults bright/festive).

---

## T120 — `synth.js` generative-audio engine (phased build per T119) — ALL 5 DONE

**Owner directive (2026-06-21): run continuously through phases 1→5, one push per
increment, no per-phase wait.** New files only (`synth.js`, `test/synth.test.js`);
**zero edits to `sound.js` or any existing Halves file** (the [A] wiring is phase 6).
No deps/bundler; no sample assets; deploy-safe; **`test/synth.test.js` = 107 checks**;
all existing gates green. Increments 1–3 already APPROVED; 4–5 below.

### Follow-up — engine gap surfaced by the T122 [A] wiring · FIXED
Reviewing the landed T122 audio wiring (it mounts `Synth` on `sound.js`'s ctx,
reroutes `output()`→Sound's master, and calls `Synth.setMuted()` from the sound
toggle), I found a real engine bug: my `setMuted()` only changed the master gain —
it left the **lookahead scheduler running**, so a muted app kept **spawning silent
voices every step** (wasted CPU/battery on the Poco-X3 budget) and music wouldn't
resume on unmute if booted muted. **Fix:** `setMuted(true)` now `stop()`s the
scheduler and `setMuted(false)` resumes the current context — mirroring `sound.js`'s
`setMuted` contract (the [A] wire calls both). Tests +4 (now **111**): mute idles the
scheduler, unmute resumes, unmute-with-no-music stays clean. `node -c` clean; all
gates green. B-owned files only.

### The engine, end to end
The full `window.Synth` API: `mount · setContext · setMusic · start/stop ·
musicPlaying · intensity(x) · play · drum · sting · setReverb · duck · setMuted ·
capabilities · output · dispose`. A context selects the calm/energetic bundle; the
single lookahead scheduler renders harmony+rhythm through real patches into the
bus/reverb graph. It delivers all four T119 quality levers — **distinct patches**,
**reverb/space**, **harmony**, **evolving variation** — so it sounds *good*, not just
different.

### Increment 5/5 — CONTEXTS + the calm-vs-energetic invariants · DONE
- **`CONTEXTS`**: `solve` (CALM — 80 BPM, Dorian, sparse, wet, soft pad+pluck),
  `menu`, `event` (BRIGHT — Lydian), `arena` (ENERGETIC — 120 BPM, dark Aeolian,
  dense, driving Euclid kit + the **wub** bass, dry). `Synth.setContext(name)` drives
  the scheduler (seed from the name → deterministic). `Synth.intensity(x)` (shared
  with the FX layer) thickens it toward the boss.
- **`Synth.sting("victory")`** — a brief one-shot (a low wub swell + a rising bright
  arpeggio) that **ducks the bed**, NOT a loop.
- **The firm rule, enforced as tests**: Arena denser + faster + drier + dark-mode +
  wub-bass + busier hats than solve; the calm pad attacks softer than the Arena lead;
  solve wetter. +15 tests (now **107**): contexts authored, every calm/energetic
  invariant, `setContext` plays + is deterministic + solve≠Arena, sting one-shot+duck.

### Hand-off to Builder A (phase 6 — the [A] audio wiring, Babysitter to spec)
- Mount once on the first gesture; reconcile output with `Sound`'s master/limiter +
  the T113/T114 volume/tempo (use `Synth.output()` / `setMuted`). Route contexts like
  the FX `fxSetScreen`: `setContext("solve"|topic)` in-round, `"menu"` on home,
  `"arena"` in the Arena (+ `intensity(bossProximity)` — the same signal the T108
  backdrop uses), `"event"` for events. Fire `Synth.sting("victory")` on an Arena win
  (pairs with the T94 burst) and `duck()` under SFX. Keep/migrate the `Sound` SFX, then
  retire the old `sound.js` music scheduler. Honour mute + the sliders + the limiter.

### Increment 4/5 — RHYTHM/VARIATION + the single lookahead scheduler · DONE
Structured, evolving variation — no obvious loops (T119 §4):
- **`euclid(k,n)`** (Toussaint even-spread grooves) + `rotate` (phase/fills);
  **`markovNext`** (a 2nd-order transition-table walk); **motif transforms**
  (`transposeMotif`/`invertMotif`/`retrograde`); **`phraseSeed`** (stable per phrase,
  evolves across phrases); **`densityAt`** (rises across a phrase — breathes/arrives).
- **`stepEvents`** (pure, deterministic): pad chord on the downbeat, bass on 1 & 3,
  a Euclid-gated Markov-walk **lead** (chord-anchored on strong beats), the Euclid
  **kit** (kick/hat/snare) — density scaled by `intensity()`.
- **The single lookahead scheduler** (Chris Wilson "two clocks"): `Synth.setMusic(spec)`
  / `start()` / `stop()` / `musicPlaying()` / `intensity(x)`. **One `setInterval`**,
  schedules precise times vs `ctx.currentTime`, **drops missed steps on a stall**
  (anti-burst), **idles on stop** — never a timer per part.
- Tests +20 (now **92**): Euclid count+even-spread+edges, rotate, Markov determinism,
  motif transforms, phraseSeed evolve, density rise, stepEvents structure; scheduler
  = **one timer**, schedules voices, **deterministic per seed**, **idles on stop**,
  **anti-burst** (a stalled clock doesn't flood), `intensity` thickens the lead.

### Increment 3/5 — HARMONY (modes · progressions · voice-leading · bass-root) · DONE
Gives the music somewhere to go (T119 §3) — pure music theory, no audio nodes:
- **Modes** (`MODES`): ionian/major, dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian,
  aeolian/minor, pentatonic(+minor), each carrying its mood colour (lydian ♯4,
  phrygian ♭2, dorian ♮6); grouped by mood in `MODE_MOOD` (bright/calm/dark) for
  context selection.
- `degToMidi` (octave-aware, wraps), `chordMidi` (diatonic stacked-third triads),
  `bassMidi` (**bass-follows-root**, low).
- **`voiceLead(prev, chord)`** — moves each voice to the nearest chord tone (≤ a
  tritone), minimising motion (flowing, not blocky).
- **`harmonyFor(spec)`** — realises a progression (`{root, mode, progression,
  padOct, bassOct}`) into per-chord `{degree, chord, voiced(pad), bass}`,
  voice-led across the progression, **deterministic** (the scheduler in increment
  4 consumes it).
- Tests +17 (now **72**): mode intervals (♯4/♭2/♮6), degree→MIDI wrap, triads
  (I=C-E-G, vi=A-C-E), voice-leading (less motion than root-position + all chord
  tones + ≤ tritone), bass-below-pad + follows-root, progression determinism +
  smoother-than-naive motion.

### Increment 2/5 — SPACE (FDN reverb + sends + stereo width + ducking) · DONE
The "biggest quality lever vs our dry sound" (T119 §6):
- **`makeReverb()` — a 4-line Feedback-Delay-Network reverb**: input → pre-delay →
  4 `DelayNode`s, each damped by a lowpass, recombined through a **unitary 4×4
  Hadamard feedback matrix scaled by `decay<1`** (dense but stable), with the taps
  **panned L/R for a wide stereo tail**. Pure WebAudio, **no sample IR**,
  real-time-tweakable (`setDamp`).
- **Sends**: one shared reverb built once at mount; **music + drum buses send into
  it** (drums kept proportionally dryer), reverb returns to master. `Synth.setReverb(wet)`.
- **Ducking**: `Synth.duck(amount, dur)` dips the music bus then recovers
  (sidechain glue so a cue/SFX cuts through) — the [A] wire fires it under stings/SFX.
- Tests +14 (now **55**): FDN 4 lines + pre-delay, per-line damping LP, **≥16
  Hadamard cross-gains** + feedback recirculation, stereo panners, music/drum sends +
  return-to-master, drums-dryer, `setReverb`, `duck` dip+recover, and **reverb built
  once** (voices don't rebuild it).

### Increment 1/5 — ENGINE CORE · DONE
New files only; zero edits to existing Halves files.

### What shipped (increment 1 — the voice/patch foundation)
- **`synth.js` / `window.Synth`** — a self-contained Web Audio engine, the start of
  the T119-recommended `synth.js` (mirrors the `fxgl.js` pattern: standalone, A wires
  it). This increment is the **engine core**, the "biggest quality jump #1: real
  patches":
  - **Master chain** mirroring `sound.js`: `master(gain) → brickwall limiter
    (DynamicsCompressor, −1.5 dB, ratio 20) → destination`, with **music / drum / sfx
    submix buses → master**. `Synth.output()` exposes the master so the [A] wire can
    re-route it into `Sound`'s master + reconcile the T113 volume/limiter.
  - **`adsr(param, t0, dur, env)`** — a real Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release on any
    `AudioParam` (amp gain *and* filter cutoff), exponential for amplitude, with a
    held-sustain stage; short notes still complete attack+decay.
  - **Voice renderer** `osc(s) → [filter (own envelope + optional LFO)] → amp(ADSR) →
    [pan] → bus`, with four engine topologies: **mono**, **unison** (detuned
    supersaw), **fm** (carrier+modulator → frequency), **sub** (the **wub** — resonant
    lowpass swept by an LFO).
  - **Patch table** — `pad · pluck · bass · bell · lead · wub` (genuinely different
    *instruments*, not one osc reskinned) + a **noise-based drum kit** (`kick` with a
    pitch-drop, `snare` = bandpassed noise + tonal body, `hat` = highpassed noise,
    `clap` = staggered bursts), all over a **procedurally-filled** (seeded, no-asset)
    noise buffer.
  - `Synth.mount(opts?)` (lazy; `opts.ctx` injects a context for tests),
    `Synth.play(patch, when?, opts?)`, `Synth.drum(piece, when?)`, `setMuted`/`isMuted`/
    `capabilities`/`dispose`. **One-shot only this increment — no scheduler, no
    timer/RAF** (the lookahead scheduler lands with the Contexts increment).

### Verification
`node -c` clean; `node test/synth.test.js` → **41 checks** via a recording
AudioContext stub (same approach as `sound.test.js`): master→limiter→destination +
3 buses wired once; **ADSR shape** (cancel→0→peak@a→sustain@a+d→hold→0, correct
release-end, short-note safety); **patch→graph** per engine (pad=3 detuned oscs+LP+pan;
bell=FM carrier+mod→freq; wub=saw+LFO→cutoff, resonant Q; bass=mono low-cut; pluck
filter-envelope sweep); **patch distinctness** (6/6 distinct signatures, ≥4 distinct
graph shapes); **drum kit** (kick pitch-drop tonal, hat/snare/clap noise-based);
**budget** (no timer/RAF in core, mute zeroes master + suppresses voices); **no sample
assets / no deps / never calls `window.Sound`**. Full existing Halves suite still green.

### Next increments (T120, one reviewable push each)
2. **Space** — FDN reverb (4–8 delay lines + damping LP) + sends + stereo width +
   ducking (T119 §6, the biggest quality lever vs today's dry sound).
3. **Harmony** — key/mode, chord progressions, voice-leading, bass-follows-root.
4. **Rhythm/variation** — Euclidean kit, 2nd-order Markov melody, motif development,
   evolving + phrase-seeded density (the single lookahead scheduler lands here).
5. **Contexts** — calm-solve set, menu, Arena + `intensity()`, event, victory wub-sting,
   with the calm-vs-energetic invariants as tests.
Then **phase 6 = [A] wiring** (Babysitter specs it): mount `Synth`, route contexts,
fire the win-sting + duck, retire the old music scheduler.

## T119 — Deep generative-audio research → principles + recommended engine ([B], doc)

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** New file only
(`docs/research-generative-audio.md`); **zero edits to any existing Halves file**
(`sound.js` untouched — integration is an [A] task, like the FX wiring). Off
stand-by: the owner asked for deep research into generative audio because the
music is "too simple and doesn't seem to be progressing."

### What shipped
- **`docs/research-generative-audio.md`** — a substantive, *applied* survey + a
  concrete recommended architecture. Grounded in a real diagnosis of `sound.js`
  (one `osc→gain` instrument played 18 ways: same envelope, no filters/ADSR,
  static root, uniformly-random "lead", dry mono, no buses) and stays inside our
  hard constraints (pure WebAudio, **no sample assets**, no-build, one lookahead
  scheduler, Poco-X3 CPU budget, Node-verifiable).
- Covers all **7 mandated areas** with concrete WebAudio node-graph code, not
  hand-waving: (1) **synthesis depth** — real ADSR, BiquadFilter + filter-envelope
  + LFO (the wub worked example), detune/unison, FM, additive, noise percussion,
  waveshaping; (2) **patch/instrument design** — a declarative patch abstraction so
  contexts differ by *instrument*; (3) **harmony** — chord progressions,
  voice-leading (nearest-tone mapper), bass-follows-root, modes-for-mood table,
  harmonic rhythm; (4) **variation** — 2nd-order Markov, Euclidean rhythms
  (`euclid(k,n)`), evolving density, phrase-seeded determinism, motif development;
  (5) **calm vs energetic** — a precise lever table (attack/harmonic-rhythm/
  density/mode/cutoff/tempo/percussion/reverb) + boss-proximity morph; (6) **mixing
  & space** — bus structure, **reverb** (recommend a light FDN, synth-IR convolver
  as upgrade — `makeIR()` included), stereo width, sidechain ducking, per-context
  balance; (7) **constraints** — incl. headless-testability.
- **Recommendation (the point):** build a **new standalone B-owned module
  `synth.js` (`window.Synth`)** mirroring the `fxgl.js` pattern (A wires it), not a
  `sound.js` rewrite — with a full API sketch, an internal architecture diagram,
  how calm-solve/wub/distinct-Arena/per-context-character fall out of it, a phased
  build path (each a reviewable [B] increment), and a headless test plan. Flags
  **patches (§1–2)** and **reverb/space (§6)** as the two highest-impact first
  steps.
- **8 cited references** (Chris Wilson "Two Clocks", MDN advanced techniques,
  Toussaint Euclidean rhythms, Monotron/wub, modes-for-mood, Markov music,
  WebAudio reverb/IR), web-researched and linked inline.

### Verification
Doc-only (no new JS this round — prototyping is optional per the DoD; the build is
the sequenced follow-up). `sound.js` and every existing file untouched; full Halves
gate suite still green (B changed only a new doc + this log).

### Hand-off / next (Builder B)
- The doc ends with a phased, reviewable build plan. Await the Babysitter's verdict
  + which increment to build first (recommended: engine core + patches, then
  reverb/space). When sequenced, I build `synth.js` + `test/synth.test.js`
  (B-owned), never touching `sound.js`; [A] wires it.

## T108 — Semantic Arena-biome backdrop derivation (engine side; [B])

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** Edited only B-owned files
(`fxgl.js`, `test/fxgl.test.js`); **zero edits to any existing Halves file**
(the [A] Arena wiring calls it, after T89/T90). Mirrors T95's discipline. No
deps/bundler; deploy-safe; all existing gates green.

### What shipped
- **New API: `FXGL.deriveArenaScene(state)`** (and `controller.setArenaState`).
  Purpose = **SENSE OF PLACE + STATUS (Arena)** — a `setScene`-shaped backdrop
  derived from **live Arena state**, not decoration:
  - `state = { region: 1..10, tier, bossProximity: 0..1 | facingBoss, mood: neutral|victory|defeat, grid?, seed?, cols?, rows? }`
  - **region** → a distinct palette + accent **kind** per region (10 engine-owned
    region moods echoing the Arena families: warren/gallows/gloam/marsh/frost/
    drown/cinder/storm/dragon/void) — a real *sense of place*.
  - **tier + boss-proximity** → **intensity** (0..1): the glow runs **hotter +
    brighter** and the particle field **denser** as the boss nears; `facingBoss`
    pins it to the peak (1.0).
  - **mood**: **victory** briefly warms/brightens + adds embers (the [A] side
    pairs it with a T94 `burst()`); **defeat** dims/cools.
  - **deterministic** from a state-derived seed (region + tier + intensity band +
    mood) — same state → same biome; it shifts as you advance.
- **Reuses the real scenery:** if the [A] caller passes `state.grid`
  (`Scenery.buildGrid(region)`), the engine renders that real silhouette
  **recoloured by the live intensity-aware palette** (hotter near a boss);
  otherwise it synthesises a grounded region backdrop (sky gradient + a hot glow
  band scaled by intensity + a dark ground silhouette).
- **Budget = T95 discipline:** capped at **`ARENA_PARTICLE_MAX = 220`** (livelier
  than home's 120 since it dresses a battle, still bounded); renders through the
  existing T93 backends — single RAF, one draw/frame, **idles when off-Arena**,
  reduced-motion → static still, no-WebGL2 → CPU still. No new GPU code.

### Brickmap borrowing (T108)
None new — pure state→scene mapping feeding the **T93** ports (Bayer dither,
luminance→palette ramp, atmospheric gradient/glow, instanced accents). The
intensity-scaled hot glow builds on T93's gradient recipe.

### Verification
`node -c` clean; `node test/fxgl.test.js` → **102 checks** (T95's 82 + 20 new):
deterministic per state; **all 10 region palettes distinct** (sense of place);
**nearer-boss → denser field + hotter/brighter glow + brighter backdrop**;
deeper tier lifts intensity; `facingBoss` = peak; **victory warms/brightens +
embers, defeat dims**; capped; region clamps; **uses the caller's scenery grid
and recolours it**; renders on a real backend (single RAF, one draw/frame,
textures once, idles), reduced-motion → static still. Full existing 24-gate
Halves suite still green.

### Hand-off to Builder A (the [A] Arena-biome wiring task, after T89/T90)
- Mount a backdrop canvas behind the Arena (`aria-hidden`,
  `pointer-events:none`); feed it the live region/tier/boss state:
  `FXGL.mount(bg, { width, height }); FXGL.setArenaState({ region, tier, bossProximity, mood, grid: Scenery.buildGrid(region) }); FXGL.start();`
  Re-call `setArenaState(...)` as the fight advances (tier up, boss approached,
  win/loss); on a win, also fire `FXGL.burst(...)` (T94) and pass `mood:"victory"`.
  `FXGL.stop()` when leaving the Arena. Keep text legible (a scrim as
  `scenery.js` does). Register the gate.

### Next (Builder B)
- Await the Babysitter's verdict + next pointer (the [A] FX wiring may preempt
  with a surfaced engine need; otherwise the next flagged [B] surface).

## T95 — Semantic home/menu backdrop (engine side; [B])

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** Edited only B-owned files
(`fxgl.js`, `test/fxgl.test.js`); **zero edits to any existing Halves file**
(the [A] side reads home state and calls the new API). No deps/bundler;
deploy-safe; all existing gates green.

### What shipped
- **New API: `FXGL.setHomeState(state)`** (and `controller.setHomeState`,
  `FXGL.deriveHomeScene(state)`). Purpose = **AMBIENT STATUS** — the home
  backdrop *reflects real state*, it is **not decoration**. It **derives** a
  calm ambient scene (the T93 dither+palette+motes layer) from live home state
  passed in by the caller:
  - `state = { progress: 0..1, streak: int, event: { palette, seed, name, mood } | null, seed?, cols?, rows? }`
  - **today's event** → the home *wears the event's palette* and its seed drives
    the look (the strongest semantic: home literally shows the day's event).
  - **momentum (progress)** → a cool→warm dawn palette + a **horizon glow that
    rises and brightens** as you progress, and a denser particle field.
  - **streak** → kind: a streak (≥3) brings warm "on-a-roll" **embers**; else
    calm **motes** (an event `mood` can override the kind).
  - **deterministic** from a state-derived seed (`seedFromHome`: event + momentum
    band + streak) — stable for a given state, shifts when the day/event or a
    milestone changes.
- **Calm + budgeted:** the home field is capped at **`HOME_PARTICLE_MAX = 120`**
  (well under the Arena's 512) so home stays legible and cheap; renders through
  the existing T93 backends (single RAF, one draw/frame, **idles when stopped /
  off-home**, reduced-motion → a static still, no-WebGL2 → the CPU still).
- Reuses the whole T93 render pipeline — `deriveHomeScene` simply emits a
  `setScene`-shaped scene, so there's no new GPU code, just the **semantic
  mapping** from state → palette/grid/particles.

### Brickmap borrowing (T95)
None new — T95 is pure state→scene mapping feeding the **T93** ports (Bayer
dither, luminance→palette ramp, atmospheric gradient, instanced motes). The
rising-dawn glow is our own, built on T93's gradient/fog recipe.

### Verification
`node -c` clean; `node test/fxgl.test.js` → **82 checks** (T94's 67 + 15 new):
deterministic for a state; **density encodes momentum** + stays ≤ cap; a
different state → a different backdrop; **the glow rises with progress**; streak
threshold switches motes→embers; **an event makes the home wear the event
palette + mood + seed**; the seed shifts when the event changes; renders through
a real backend on a **single RAF, one draw/frame, idles when stopped**, and
**reduced-motion → a static still**. Full existing 24-gate Halves suite green.

### Hand-off to Builder A (the [A] home-backdrop wiring task)
- Mount a backdrop canvas *behind* the (compact, T91) home UI
  (`aria-hidden`, `pointer-events:none`), then feed it the **real** home state:
  `FXGL.mount(bg, { width, height }); FXGL.setHomeState({ progress, streak, event }); FXGL.start();`
  Re-call `setHomeState(...)` when state changes (return-to-home / new event /
  streak tick); `FXGL.stop()` when leaving home (idles the RAF). Source the
  inputs from the live home model (progress from collection/mastery, streak from
  the day-counter, `event` from today's event theme). Keep the home one-screen +
  legible (a scrim if needed, as `scenery.js`/Arena does). Register the CI gate.

### Next (Builder B)
- Await the Babysitter's verdict + next pointer (more FX surfaces are flagged as
  follow-ups once the foundation proves on a real Poco-X3-class device).

## T94 — Celebration-burst capability on `fxgl.js` (engine side; [B])

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** Edited only B-owned files
(`fxgl.js`, `test/fxgl.test.js`); **zero edits to any existing Halves file**
(wiring the burst onto real win/collectible-gain hooks in `main.js` is the
[A] *T94w* task). No deps/bundler; deploy-safe; all existing gates green.

### What shipped
- **New API: `FXGL.burst({ x, y, palette, count, seed })`** (and
  `controller.burst(...)`). Purpose = **CELEBRATION** — a brief, capped, seeded
  flourish to *amplify a reward*. `x,y` are normalised [0,1] screen coords
  (default centre); `palette` tints it (default warm gold/white); `count` is
  clamped to `BURST_CAP` (256); `seed` makes it **deterministic**.
- **Consistent with the T93 engine philosophy:** each burst particle stores its
  launch point/velocity/life/spin in a **static instance buffer** uploaded once;
  the trajectory is **closed-form ballistic** (terminal-velocity drag,
  `v' = g − k·v`) evaluated **in-shader** from `uTime`, so a burst stays **one
  upload + one instanced draw/frame** and needs no per-frame CPU stepping.
- **Auto-stops, no RAF leak.** Particles self-expire (alpha 0 after `life`); the
  controller deactivates the burst once `elapsed > maxDeath`, clears the buffer,
  and lets the **single shared RAF** idle. A burst can run with **no ambient
  scene** (a transparent overlay surface) or **over** a running T93 scene (the
  loop is shared — scene field + burst = 2 instanced draws/frame).
- **Flurries coalesce.** Rapid gains stack into one rolling buffer (each particle
  carries its own `birth`), capped at `BURST_CAP` (oldest dropped) — never a
  runaway.
- **Reduced-motion → a calm flourish** (not nothing, per the DoD): fewer
  particles, lower speed, no gravity tumble, shorter life — and it still
  auto-stops. The additive `pointer-events:none` overlay never blocks text
  (readability stays the [A] mount's concern; engine draws behind/around DOM).
- **All three backends** carry it: WebGL2 (a 3rd program reusing the splat FS),
  WebGPU (a 3rd pipeline + WGSL module), and a light CPU 2D flourish for no-GPU.

### Brickmap borrowing (T94)
Extends the **T93** ports — same instanced-billboard splat recipe (disc mask +
additive falloff from `splat.wgsl`) and the **xorshift32** seed RNG
(`particles.rs`); the burst adds a closed-form drag trajectory (the analytic
solution of `particles.rs`'s gravity+drag integration). No new brickmap read was
required; no Rust/WASM pulled in.

### Verification
`node -c` clean; `node test/fxgl.test.js` → **67 checks** (T93's 46 + 21 new):
seedBurst capped/deterministic/calmer-under-reduced; `burstPos` lifecycle
(invisible before birth & after life, visible mid-life); `burstMaxDeath`; the
controller burst **pumps one RAF**, **one instanced draw/frame**, **auto-stops
with no leak**, **caps at BURST_CAP**, runs **standalone or over a scene** (2
draws/frame, textures still uploaded once), and the **reduced-motion calm
flourish** also auto-stops. Full existing 24-gate Halves suite still green
(B touched nothing else).

### Hand-off to Builder A (the [A] *T94w* wiring task)
- Mount a full-screen, `aria-hidden`, `pointer-events:none` overlay canvas;
  `const fx = FXGL.mount(overlay, { width, height });` then call
  `fx.burst({ x, y, palette, seed })` on the **existing** win/unlock moments:
  Arena victory (T90 playout) and collectible/loot/event-reward gains. `x,y` =
  the gain's on-screen point normalised to [0,1] (else it defaults to centre);
  `palette` can follow the reward's rarity colours. The burst auto-stops, so no
  teardown is needed between events. Register `test/fxgl.test.js` as a CI gate
  (still the [A] wiring task's call, alongside the T93 mount).

### Next (Builder B)
- The engine side of **T95** (semantic home/menu backdrop driven by live
  event/progress state), per the REVIEW.md pointer.

## T93 — `fxgl.js` FX engine (standalone, brickmap-borrowed, headless-tested)

**Status: DONE — handed off for review.** New files only; zero edits to existing
Halves files; no bundler/deps; deploy-safe; all existing gates stay green.

### What shipped
- **`fxgl.js`** — a self-contained `window.FXGL` engine. Clean, mountable API:
  - `FXGL.mount(canvas, opts) → controller` (also becomes the active singleton).
  - `FXGL.setScene({ palette?, grid, particles?, seed? })` — `grid` is the exact
    shape `scenery.js` emits (a COLS×ROWS array of hex colours); `palette` is
    optional (derived from the grid when omitted); `particles` is
    `{ count, kind, colors }` with `kind ∈ motes|embers|snow|stars`.
  - `FXGL.start()` / `FXGL.stop()` (caller owns the single RAF).
  - `FXGL.setQuality(0|1|2)` (degrade ladder), `FXGL.dispose()`,
    `FXGL.capabilities()`, `FXGL.resize()`.
  - Pure scene/dither/particle math is also exported (headless-tested).
- **Three backends, one API:**
  - **WebGPU** (progressive enhancement, WebGPU-*first*): resolved async via
    `requestAdapter`/`requestDevice` *before* the canvas context is bound (a
    canvas binds one graphics API), falling back if it fails.
  - **WebGL2** (baseline): the live path on the midrange floor.
  - **CPU still** (no-GPU): a static, CPU-dithered, palette-quantised still — the
    layer is reversible to today's static look.
- **Reduced motion** → a single static still, never a RAF. **No GPU** → the CPU
  still. Honoured by `prefers-reduced-motion` and by capability detection.
- **Purpose = PLACE.** The engine only renders a real theme (a scenery grid +
  accents); `deriveScene` *rejects a grid-less scene*, so it can't become a
  generic screensaver. The base texture is the literal scenery grid; the palette
  ramp is built from that grid's own colours.
- **`test/fxgl.test.js`** — 46 headless checks via `node test/fxgl.test.js`:
  pure Bayer dither / luminance-ramp quantise / particle-seed math; the "renders
  a real scenery theme not noise" proof (feeds an actual `Scenery.buildGrid`);
  budget invariants (single loop, one frame in flight, capped buffer, idle when
  stopped); a **recording WebGL2 stub** asserting **one instanced draw per frame**
  and a **one-time texture upload** (no per-frame re-upload); and the
  reduced-motion / no-GPU still fallbacks.

### Brickmap borrowing — RECIPES, not the engine
Read `00-1/brickmap`'s `crates/bm-render/src/*.wgsl` and **ported the techniques**
into our own no-build JS WebGL2/WebGPU layer. **No Rust/WASM/wgpu pulled into
Halves** (test asserts this) — keeps no-build + Node-verify + a11y.

| Borrowed technique | brickmap source | Where in `fxgl.js` |
|---|---|---|
| Ordered **4×4 Bayer dither** matrix `[0,8,2,10,12,4,14,6,3,11,1,9,15,7,13,5]` | `palette.wgsl`, `splat.wgsl` (`bayer4`) | `BAYER`, `bayer4()`, both scene shaders |
| **Luminance→palette-ramp quantise** (tonal gradient-map / poster look; dither nudges across stops) | `palette.wgsl` `fs_main` | `buildRamp`, `rampIndex`, `quantizePixel`, scene FS/WGSL |
| **Screen-space atmospheric gradient / fog** (a slow drifting band) | `sky.wgsl` | the `uTime` fog term in the scene FS/WGSL |
| **Instanced billboard particle splats** (disc mask, wind sway via `sin(time+phase)`, per-particle hash/phase, animate in-shader from a static buffer) | `splat.wgsl`, `particles.rs` | particle VS/FS, `seedParticles`, `animateParticle` |
| **xorshift32** deterministic RNG | `particles.rs` `rand()` | `makeRng` |

Deliberately **not** ported: brickmap decodes sRGB→linear because its target
re-encodes on store; our plain canvas displays sRGB values directly, so porting
that would double-darken — left out on purpose.

### Deviations from the T93 brief
- None of substance. WebGPU is implemented real (browser-only; not exercised by
  the Node stub, which targets the WebGL2 path — the DoD allows "a WebGL/WebGPU
  stub"). The headless stub proves the WebGL2 path's single-draw / one-time-upload
  invariants.

### Hand-off to Builder A (the [A] *T93w* wiring task)
- Add `<script src="fxgl.js">` and mount on the Arena backdrop canvas:
  `FXGL.mount(canvas, { width, height }); FXGL.setScene({ grid: Scenery.buildGrid(region), seed: region, particles: { kind, count } }); FXGL.start();`
  Keep the canvas `aria-hidden` + `pointer-events:none`; `FXGL.stop()` when the
  Arena is off-screen (idle). Register `test/fxgl.test.js` as a CI gate in
  `pages.yml`. Particle `kind` can follow the region's scenery accent
  (embers/snow/stars), else `motes`.

### Next (Builder B)
- The engine sides of **T94** (celebration bursts) and **T95** (semantic home
  backdrop driven by live event/progress state), per the REVIEW.md pointer.
