# Builder log (Builder-owned) — Babysitter reads

Append a handoff entry after each push. Keep newest at the bottom. Template:

```
## T<n> — <title>  [HANDOFF | BLOCKED]
commit: <sha>
changed: <files / summary>
how I verified:
  - node -c: <result>
  - id cross-check: <result>
  - logic check: <what you ran + result>
  - no TODO/placeholder introduced: <result>
notes / questions: <anything the Babysitter should know>
```

Use `BLOCKED:` (not a handoff) if the task is underspecified or wrong — then wait.

## T1 — Topic-chain unlock  [HANDOFF]
commit: f7e4a25
changed:
  - modes.js — reordered MODES to importance order (Halves → Times → Doubles →
    Fractions → Squares) and added `unlockedBy` to each non-first mode
    (times←halves, doubles←times, fractions←doubles, squares←fractions).
  - main.js — added `isUnlocked(m)` (first-in-chain OR prev topic's `init:`
    owned OR own `init:` owned for migration); default mode falls back to the
    first unlocked topic if a saved last-mode is locked; renderTabs marks locked
    topics (🔒 + `.locked`); selectMode previews a locked topic's requirement
    without persisting it as default; renderBest shows the unlock requirement
    for a locked topic; new renderStartState() disables Start when locked;
    start() guards against locked play; route + init wire renderStartState.
  - styles.css — `.mode-tab.locked`, `.mode-tab .lk`, and `.btn:disabled` styles.
how I verified:
  - node -c: modes.js OK, main.js OK, collectibles.js OK.
  - id cross-check: every `$("id")` in main.js exists in index.html (incl.
    startBtn used by renderStartState); 0 missing.
  - logic check: Node harness loading the real modes.js asserts — fresh profile
    → only Halves playable; finishing each topic unlocks exactly the next
    (Halves→Times→Doubles→Fractions→Squares); migration (owning `init:squares`
    keeps Squares unlocked while Fractions stays locked). Also re-verified every
    generator’s answers are numeric, non-negative and numpad-enterable (≤5
    digits, digits + "."). ALL CHECKS PASSED.
  - no TODO/placeholder introduced: grep of changed files clean (only pre-existing
    `.placeholder` CSS class / DOM hook, not introduced here).
  - regressions: only `MODES[0]` fallbacks remain (no hardcoded order assumptions);
    collectible catalogue unchanged at 275 items with all `init:` ids present;
    routing/summary/inventory/build-info untouched.
notes / questions: Existing modes only (Halves, Times, Doubles, Fractions,
  Squares) — new topics will splice into the chain at their importance position
  in their own tasks (T5+). "Selecting a locked topic shows the requirement" is
  implemented via the start-screen best line + disabled Start; the richer picker
  is T3.

## T2 — Mastery achievement + Part-2 gate plumbing  [HANDOFF]
commit: 1f5dedb (on main)
changed:
  - modes.js — added `masterSecs` to all 5 modes per the BACKLOG tier table
    (halves 4, times 3.5, doubles 4, fractions 3.5, squares 3.5). Documented
    `masterSecs` + the `requires:"mastery:<id>"` Part-2 convention in the header.
  - collectibles.js — new "Mastery" category (added to CATS, slotted after
    Speed) and a `mastery:<id>` item per mode (rarity epic). Its test = round
    finished with 0 skips AND `totalTime ≤ mode.masterSecs × total` (i.e. avg ≤
    masterSecs). Awarded automatically through the existing `evaluate()` path in
    finish() (per-mode `modeId` filter keeps it scoped to the played mode).
  - main.js — `isUnlocked()` now honours `requires:"mastery:<id>"` (Part-2 gate)
    AND `unlockedBy` (chain), with own-`init:` migration overriding both; new
    `unlockHint()` produces the right hint for chain vs Part-2 locks (used by the
    locked best-line). New `showTopicToast(m)` fires a celebratory toast when a
    topic becomes newly playable; finish() snapshots unlock state before awarding
    collectibles and toasts any topic opened this round ("Topic unlocked" for
    chain, "Part 2 unlocked" for mastery gates).
  - styles.css — `.toast .t-glyph` badge styling for the topic-unlock toast.
how I verified:
  - node -c: modes.js, collectibles.js, main.js all OK.
  - id cross-check: every `$("id")` in main.js present in index.html; 0 missing.
  - logic check (Node, loading the real modes/collectibles): masterSecs correct
    on all 5 modes; mastery item present per mode in category "Mastery";
    boundary cases via the real catalogue test — AT target → mastered, just
    under → mastered, just over → NOT, 1 skip (even if fast) → NOT; `evaluate()`
    awards mastery only for the played mode and only when earned; the
    `requires` gate locks a synthetic Part-2 mode until `mastery:<part1>` is
    owned (mere Part-1 `init` is not enough), with migration via own `init`;
    combined requires+unlockedBy needs both; T1 chain regression intact;
    catalogue grew exactly 275→280. ALL CHECKS PASSED.
  - no TODO/placeholder introduced: grep clean (only the pre-existing
    `.placeholder` answer hint, untouched).
  - no regressions: `m.glyph` in the toast is the same trusted mode HTML
    `renderMark()` already injects; inventory skips empty categories so the new
    Mastery section only shows with items; routing/build-info/HOF untouched.
notes / questions: No Part-2 modes ship in this task by design — T2 is plumbing,
  proven by the Node gate test. The unlock toast fires for BOTH chain and Part-2
  unlocks (matches research §Mechanics "Unlocks fire a celebratory toast"); it is
  additive to the existing end-of-round collectible modal, not a replacement.
