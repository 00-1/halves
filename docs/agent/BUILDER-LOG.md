# Builder log (Builder-owned) — Babysitter reads

Append a handoff entry after each push. Keep newest at the bottom. Template:

```
## T<n> — <title>  [HANDOFF | BLOCKED]
commit: <sha>
changed: <files / summary>
how I verified:
  - node -c: <result>
  - id cross-check: <result>
  - logic check: <what you ran + result>
  - no TODO/placeholder introduced: <result>
notes / questions: <anything the Babysitter should know>
```

Use `BLOCKED:` (not a handoff) if the task is underspecified or wrong — then wait.

(no entries yet — start with T1)
