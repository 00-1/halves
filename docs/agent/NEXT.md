**Builder A → `T182` 🔴 (HOARD FIX — make the pile visible) → `T179` (Codex) → `T180` (`?dev` reveal-all)**
**🔴 `T182` FIRST — the owner can't see the hoard at all.** Root cause: `GOLD_FULL=1e10` + power curve → at real
gold (~1.23K) the pile is **~0.17% = invisible**; and the pile renders on HOME, not in the graphics menu. Fix:
1. **Recalibrate to a LOG-OF-MAGNITUDE curve** — `level = clamp(log10(1+gold)/log10(GOLD_FULL_MAG),0,1)`,
   `GOLD_FULL_MAG`≈1e12–1e15 → 1K≈25%, 1M≈50%, 1B≈75%, 1T≈full. Pile visible from the start, grows across K→M→B→T.
2. **A `?dev` Graphics-menu gold-setter that ACTUALLY sets the real gold counter** (owner: *"actually change my
   Goblin Gold counter"*) — real `saveGold()` buttons for `0/1K/100K/1M/100M/1Bn/1T`; each refreshes the pill +
   home pile + milestones (pick a value → go home → see the pile). NOT a sandboxed preview. `?dev`-gated + on the
   publish checklist (it edits the save).
3. **Earn-burst flies OUTWARD** (drop the `tx/ty` converge — the prior follow-up, folded in).
4. Minor (owner OK): burst coins are squares not beveled — pass/apply `look:"coin"`.
[A]-only. *(BACKLOG T182.)*
- **Then `T179` (Codex)** (Beasts/Bosses/Realms/Events **+ Emblems** from B's `T181`) → **`T180`** (`?dev`
  reveal-all). *(`T168` Play-Store held for ID-verify.)*
**Re-read this line fresh before each task + push.**

**Builder B → `T181` (`emblems.js` brand emblems) → `T183` (RESEARCH: study/focus-friendly music — `lofi` too dark/bassy).**
`T181` first (the app-icon/Codex emblems — see below). **Then `T183`:** owner — *"audio switching sounds very good
now; the Lo-Fi Study sounds a bit dark/bassy. Research what's nice to listen to while studying / being tested."* A
short research pass on focus/test-condition music for ~10-yr-olds → a concrete **`lofi` revision** (warmer/brighter,
less bass/dark) + any calm-context tweaks; keep per-style distinctness + the T175 stability (no foghorn). B-owned
(`synth.js` + tests). *(BACKLOG T183.)*
**`T181`:** build NEW standalone `emblems.js` (`window.Emblems = { draw(canvas,id), IDS }`) — the brand-emblem
candidates in the generative pixel/dither style, gold-on-purple, maskable-safe (icon 48→512 + Codex tile): `coin`
(beveled goblin-stamped coin + glint), `goblin`, `hoard`, `voidthrone`, `crowncoin`. Deterministic + headless-test
(`test/emblems.test.js`). **B-owned only**; never touch existing Halves files; never push `claude/agent`.---
