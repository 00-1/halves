**Builder A → `T201` 🔴 (stale manifest/icon cache) → then `T198` (fill curve).** `T194` + earlier A work APPROVED
(live `751cbe7`).
- **🔴 `T201` — install shows the OLD name "Halves" + `x/2` icon, NOT "Goblin Gold"/Magnar** (owner screenshots).
  Root cause: `index.html` links `manifest.webmanifest` as a **bare URL** (no `?v=`) and the icon `src`s are bare,
  but `sw.js` is **cache-first for everything except nav + `build.json`** (safe only for the `?v=`-versioned JS/CSS).
  So the manifest + icons are served from the **first-ever cache forever** → frozen install identity. **Fix:** serve
  `manifest.webmanifest` + the icon files **NETWORK-FIRST** (add them to the nav/`build.json` branch in `sw.js`), and
  **bump `CACHE` v3→v4** so existing users get purged on next visit. DoD: after a normal revisit the Install dialog
  shows **Goblin Gold + Magnar**, and future deploys propagate. [A]-only (`sw.js`, `index.html`). **Launch blocker.**
  *(BACKLOG T201.)*
- **`T198` — hoard fills too fast.** `hoardLevel = log10(1+gold)/log10(1e12)` → 25% at 1k, 40% at 60k. Recurve with a
  **floor-offset log**: `clamp((log10(1+gold)−log10(GOLD_EMPTY))/(log10(GOLD_FULL)−log10(GOLD_EMPTY)),0,1)`,
  `GOLD_EMPTY`≈100–1k, `GOLD_FULL`≈1e15 → **1k≈5%, 60k≈15–20%, 1M≈30%, 1Bn≈55%, 1T≈75%, 1e15 full** (tune vs
  `economy-sim.js`; small visible starter pile). **Visual only.** [A]-only (`main.js`, `GOLD-HOARD-DESIGN.md`).
  *(BACKLOG T198.)* Then **`T168`** stays HELD on the owner's Play ID verification.
**Re-read this line fresh before each task + push.**

**Builder B → `T193` 🔴 (RE-OPENED bug) → `T197` → `T199` → `T200`.** `T192`/`T195`/`T196` APPROVED (live `751cbe7`).
- **🔴 `T193` — money-gain burst STILL shows no coins (squares), owner on PWA.** REAL bug, not cache: the shower
  uses `fxBurst.burst({look:"coin"})` → `Controller.burst()` → **`seedBurst`, which never sets `look` on its
  particles** (fxgl.js ~:256), so `p.look===1` is always false → squares. (Only `seedConverge` sets `look:1`; the
  outward money-gain uses the ballistic `burst()`.) `drawCoinParticle`/overlay/inline are all correct — they just
  never receive a coin-tagged particle. **FIX:** `seedBurst` honors `opts.look==="coin"` → `look:1` (+ the spin
  fields `aspect`/`glint`, `vrot` exists) so coins render on CPU inline AND GL/GPU overlay; keep it OUTWARD (T173).
  **Add the missing gate** (a `look:"coin"` ballistic burst must tag `look===1` particles). [B]-only (`fxgl.js`, tests).
- **`T197` — the COINS need the dither/pixelation too** (T195 filtered the SHAPE, not the coins). Put the coins
  through the same brickmap halftone-dither (recommend one pixelate + Bayer post-process over the whole hoard 2D
  overlay; or quantise each coin's tones via T195's gold-ramp+`bayer4`). **NO colour shift** (owner dropped it).
- **`T199` — a full pile must reach the TOP of the screen** (`HOARD_MAX_H` 0.82 → ~0.95–1.0; level 1.0 fills it —
  after T198 that's peak wealth, 1T reads ~75% tall).
- **`T200` — coin COLOUR by height:** dark coins lower, light coins higher (bias each coin's gold tone by its
  fill-rank `q`; keep a mix at every level; deterministic/stable with T196). Not a hard split, a gradient.
- All [B]-only (`fxgl.js`, tests). *(BACKLOG T193/T197/T199/T200.)*
**Re-read this line fresh before each task + push.**

**Owner device-confirm:** the Magnar app icon (reinstall the PWA to see the launcher icon). **Force-refresh the PWA**
before re-testing any hoard change (the service worker caches). Lofi (T190) already confirmed ✓.
